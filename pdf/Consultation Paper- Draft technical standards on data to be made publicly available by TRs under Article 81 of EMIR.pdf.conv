1  Executive Summary 

Reasons for publication 

Article 81 of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 
4 July 2012 on OTC Derivatives, CCPs and Trade Repositories (EMIR) requires ESMA to 
develop draft regulatory technical standards specifying the frequency and the details of the 
information  to  be  made  available  to  the  relevant  authorities  and  the  information  to  be 
published by trade repositories.  

Public data has experienced several problems related to the comparison and aggregation 
of  data  across  trade  repositories.  Therefore,  ESMA  is  setting  out  several  proposals  to 
enhance  the  data  made  publicly  available  by  trade  repositories  and  to  increase  the 
transparency to the public in general as well as allowing the publication of certain figures 
required by EU regulations such as MiFID II and the Benchmarks Regulation. 

Contents 

This document presents the proposals related to the publication of data by trade repositories 
and in particular for the avoidance of double counting of cleared derivatives, on the details 
of aggregations for commodity derivatives and derivatives using benchmarks, as well as on 
the general technical aspects of publication of aggregate data.  

Next Steps 

ESMA is consulting publicly on the proposed standards for aggregation of data to be made 
publicly  available.  Following  the  finalisation  of  the  consultation  period  of  the  proposed 
technical standards, ESMA will be preparing a final report to be submitted to the European 
Commission for its endorsement.

2  Review  of  the  EMIR  Technical  Standards  on  data  to  be 

made publicly available 

2.1  Background 

1.  Article 81 of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council 
of 4 July 2012 on OTC derivatives, CCPs and trade repositories (EMIR) requires ESMA to 
develop draft regulatory technical standards specifying the frequency and the details of the 
information  to  be  made  available  to  the  relevant  authorities  and  the  information  to  be 
published  as  well  as  operational  standards  required  in  order to  aggregate  and  compare 
data across repositories and for the relevant authorities to have access to information as 
necessary.  

2.  ESMA  fulfilled  this  mandate  in  September  2012  and  submitted  those  drafts  to  the 
Commission,  which  became  the  Commission  Delegated  Regulation  (EU)  No.  151/2013 
(RTS, hereafter). 

3.  The RTS consisted of a definition of the data (i) to be made publicly available on a weekly 
basis by the trade repositories (TRs, hereunder), (ii) the access levels for EEA and third 
country  authorities,  as  well  as  (iii)  a  brief  reference  to  the  use  of  communication 
procedures, standards for messaging and reference data used at international level without 
specifying or prescribing standards to be used.  

4.  This  consultation  paper  focuses  on  the  aggregate  position  data  to  be  made  publicly 
available  by  the  TRs  under  EMIR  and  specifies  the  relevant  operational  standards  to 
compare and aggregate this type of data across TRs. 

5.  At the time of drafting the RTS (2011-2012), there were still a number of discussions at 
international  level  on  the  aggregation  of  data  across  TRs.  The  final  report  from  CPSS-
IOSCO on “OTC derivatives data reporting and aggregation requirements” 1 was published 
in January 2012, while the “FSB Feasibility Study on Aggregation of OTC Derivatives Trade 
Repository Data”2 did not start until early 2014 and the publication of the final Study took 
place only in September 2014. Therefore, ESMA decided to keep the wording of the RTS 
sufficiently flexible to accommodate further developments of international standards. 

6.  The standards for data to be made publicly available were an area where ESMA could not 
build on lessons learnt. The practical implementation of EMIR reporting and the experience 
gained so far has shown several shortcomings and limitations that need to be addressed 
so that the data published by the trade repositories under EMIR can be better used by the 
general public.  

7.  Due to non-standard, sometimes insufficient tools and functionalities provided by TRs, the 
public  needed  to  spend  considerable  time  accessing  the  websites  of  the  different  TRs,

ESMA REGULAR USE 

downloading  files  in  TR-customised  formats  published  with  different  frequencies, 
translating them into a common one, and finally trying to aggregate it across all the TRs. 
These are all overly manual processes. As a result, the EMIR public data was difficult to 
use and the transparency of derivatives towards the general public was not achieved.  

8.  As  part  of  its  supervisory  actions,  ESMA  discussed  and  agreed  with  the  TRs  the 
implementation  of  several  practical  aspects  to  overcome  some  of  the  aforementioned 
issues and to increase the value for the public of the EMIR aggregated data. Following this 
initiative, common templates were adopted and data started becoming more comparable. 

9.  In  the  meantime,  several  other  EU  regulations  are  requiring  entities  to  assess  their 
activities with regards to derivatives concluded in the EU. Three years after the start of the 
reporting  obligation  the  TRs  have  gained  considerable  experience  with  regards  to 
derivatives data and have demonstrated being able to put in place complex reporting and 
data  processing  systems.  From  that  perspective,  and  taking  into  account  that  EMIR 
reporting  comprises  both  exchange-trade  derivatives  and  OTC  derivatives,  ESMA 
understands that the TRs are in a privileged position to provide the most comprehensive 
derivatives  data  aggregation  in  the  EU.  Expanding  and  making  more  granular  the 
information that TRs will need to publish appears necessary to make a better use of the 
stream  of  data  reaching  TRs  and  to  provide  the  best  possible  aggregated  data that  EU 
financial markets need for functioning under the current regulatory framework. 

2.2  Trading activity on commodity derivatives under MiFID 

10. Article 2 of draft RTS 20 under Directive 2014/65/EU3 (MIFID II, hereinafter) requires the 
assessment  of  the  size  of  the  trading  activity  in  commodity  derivatives,  emission 
allowances  and  derivatives  of  persons  performing  activities  under  MIFID  II  in  order  to 
assess the application of certain exemptions. In that regard, ESMA sees additional benefits 
from providing aggregation of the different types of commodities derivatives concluded in 
the EU. 

11. Article  2(1)(j)  of  MiFID  II  grants  persons  performing  MiFID  II  activities  in  commodity 
derivatives, emission allowances and derivatives thereof an exemption if their activities are 
ancillary to their main business. Article 2(4) of MiFID II requires such persons to compare 
the  size  of  their  trading  activity  in  commodity  derivatives,  emission  allowances  and 
derivatives thereof to the overall market trading activity in a particular asset class over a 
certain period of time (the trading activity test).  

12. The asset classes and the relevant thresholds per asset class have been further specified 
by ESMA in draft RTS which are yet to be endorsed by the European Commission. The 
relevant RTS by ESMA went through an opinion process in accordance with Article 10 of 
Regulation  (EU)  1095/2010  where  the  trading  activity  test  has  not  been  subject  to  any

objection  by  the  European  Commission  so  ESMA  considers  the  trading  activity  test  as 
designed as stable.  

13. Persons wanting to benefit from the MiFID II exemption in Article 2(1)(j) of MIFID therefore 
have to execute a test where they compare their own trading to the total trading in the EU 
market based on eight distinct asset classes. 

2.3  Benchmarks Regulation 

14. Regulation  (EU)  No  2016/1011  on  benchmarks  (BMR,  hereinafter)  requires  the 
establishment of appropriate measurement for measuring the nominal amount of financial 
instruments  other than  derivatives,  the  notional  amount  of derivatives  and  the  net  asset 
value of investment funds for the purposes of assessing benchmarks under the thresholds 
in Article 20(1) and Article 24(1)(a) of BMR. Depending on the nature of the benchmark the 
assessment is performed either by the European Commission, by the relevant competent 
authorities or by the administrators. 

15. The European Commission proposed a draft Regulation on indexes used as benchmarks 
in  financial  instruments  and  financial  contracts4 in  September  2013  in  the  wake  of  the 
manipulation  of  various  benchmarks.  An  agreement  was  reached  with  the  European 
Parliament  in  November  2015.  Regulation  (EU)  2016/1011  of  the  European  Parliament 
and of the Council of 8 June 2016 on indexes used as benchmarks in financial instruments 
and financial contracts or to measure the performance of investment funds and amending 
Directives  2008/48/EC  and  2014/17/EU  and  Regulation  (EU)  No  596/2014,  (BMR, 
hereinafter) was published on 29 June 2016. 

16. Under Article 20(1) of BMR, the European Commission “shall adopt implementing acts in 
accordance  with  the  examination  procedure  referred  to  in  Article  50(2)  to  establish  and 
review  at  least  every  two  years  a  list  of  benchmarks  provided  by  administrators  located 
within  the  Union  which  are  critical  benchmarks,  provided  that  one  of  the  following 
conditions is fulfilled: the benchmark is used directly or indirectly within a combination of 
benchmarks as a reference for financial instruments or financial contracts or for measuring 
the performance of investment funds, having a total value of at least EUR 500 billion on 
the basis of all the range of maturities or tenors of the benchmark, where applicable (…).” 

17. Furthermore,  under  Article  20(6)  of  BMR  it  is  provided  that  the  Commission  shall  be 
empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 49 BMR in order to specify 
how  the  nominal  amount  of  financial  instruments  other  than  derivatives,  the  notional 
amount  of  derivatives  and  the  net  asset  value  of  investment  funds  are  to  be  assessed, 
including  in  the  event  of  an  indirect  reference  to  a  benchmark  within  a  combination  of 
benchmarks, in order to be compared with the thresholds referred to in Article 20(1) of BMR 
and in point (a) of Article 24(1) of BMR.

18. Article  24(1)(a)  of  BMR  provides  that  “a  benchmark  which  does  not  fulfil  any  of  the 
conditions laid down in Article 20(1) is significant when it is used directly or indirectly within 
a combination of benchmarks as a reference for financial instruments or financial contracts 
or for measuring the performance of investments funds having a total average value of at 
least EUR 50 billion on the basis of all the range of maturities or tenors of the benchmark, 
where applicable, over a period of six months” 

19. Under  Article  24(2)  of  BMR  the  European  Commission  shall  be  empowered  to  adopt 
delegated acts in accordance with Article 49 in order to review the calculation method used 
to determine the threshold referred to in point (a) of Article24 (1) of BMR “in the light of 
market,  price  and  regulatory  developments  as  well  as  the  appropriateness  of  the 
classification of benchmarks with a total value of financial instruments, financial contracts 
or investment funds referencing them that is close to that threshold. Such review shall take 
place at least every two years as from 1 January 2018. 

20. Finally, it is provided that an administrator shall immediately notify its competent authority 
when its significant benchmark falls below the threshold mentioned in point (a) of Article 
24(1) of BMR. 

21. On  11  February  2016,  ESMA  received  a  request  from  the  European  Commission  for 

technical advice on possible delegated acts5 under the BMR.  

22. In order to facilitate data aggregations and links between the different types of benchmarks 
used, ESMA has included in its final report on the technical advice under Article 20(1) and 
Article  24(1)(a)  of  BMR  a  recommendation  to  request  the  benchmark  administrators  to 
obtain an ISIN for all their indexes. 

23. However, co-legislators have not envisaged a specific mechanism to measure and publish 
the  total  use  of  a  specific  benchmark.  Absent  this  publication,  it  would  be  difficult  if  not 
impossible  to  conduct  the  measurement  of  the  conditions  mentioned  above.  ESMA 
considers that TR regulated data constitutes the best alternative for these calculations. 

2.4  Areas with proposed amendments to the RTS 

24. While it was not an original objective of EMIR to provide granular aggregate position data 
to  the  public,  ESMA  understands that  establishing  a  comprehensive framework  for  data 
aggregation is essential to achieve the objectives for derivatives transparency set out by 
the G20 in September 2009. While defining the data aggregations per class of derivative 
to be performed, ESMA leverages on its experience with granular derivatives data and also 
ensures that the details published would allow for the comparison and aggregation of data 
across TRs.

ESMA REGULAR USE 

25. Under  Article  2(6)  of  EMIR,  a  class  of  derivative  is  defined  as  “a  subset  of  derivatives 
sharing common and essential characteristics including at least the relationship with the 
underlying  asset,  the  type  of  underlying  asset,  and  currency  of  notional  amount.” 
Furthermore, it is specified that “Derivatives belonging to the same class may have different 
maturities.” In that respect, while drafting the initial requirements for data aggregation under 
Article 1 of RTS, ESMA referred only to the lowest level of granularity, i.e. the asset class 
of  a  derivatives  without  further  specifying  the  rest  of  elements.  In  the  proposals  in  this 
consultation  paper,  ESMA  is  further  specifying  those  elements  for  derivatives  in  the 
commodities asset class and for derivatives that use indexes. 

26. The  definitions  on  data  access  that  are  used  in  EMIR  are  fully  consistent  with  those 
included in the Final report on “Authorities access to trade repository data“ issued in August 
2013 by CPSS-IOSCO6. In that regard, aggregate positions refer to both gross and netted 
data attributable to all participants that may be summed using various categories, including 
by  product,  currency,  region,  underlying,  etc.  that  are  not  specific  to  any  uniquely 
identifiable participant or transaction.   

27. Furthermore,  as  mentioned  in  sections  2.2  and  2.3,  there  are  two  EU  regulations,  in 
particular MiFID II and BMR, which require the use of EU aggregate derivatives data for 
different  purposes.  In  one  case,  MiFID  II  provides  that  market  participants  assess  their 
trading  volumes  in  certain  classes  of  commodity  derivatives.  In  the  other  case,  BMR 
establishes that index providers assess the significance of their respective indexes vis-à-
vis  a  threshold  established  in  the  BMR.  In the  absence  of TR  data  these  entities  would 
need  to  run  complex  processes  to  compile  the  data  across  all  the  different  venues  and 
post-trade providers. Clearly this process would not be error-free and it is highly possible 
that there will be different figures obtained by each entity. This would run contrary to the 
objectives of the regulations and would create an unlevelled playing field.  

28. From  the  perspective  of  the  supervisory  authorities  such  situation  would  significantly 
hamper  the  fulfilment  of  their  duties.  Should  the  authorities  be  required  to  recreate  the 
aggregations from the derivatives data to which they have access, it will be impossible to 
compare  the  results,  since  every  authority  has  different  access  levels  based  on  its 
responsibilities and mandates. In case it would be for ESMA to perform these aggregations, 
such task would be overly burdensome and, most importantly, ESMA would lack the direct 
contact  with  the  reporting  entities  should  any  amendments  to  the  underlying  data  be 
needed. TRs are therefore a natural choice in this regard as they play a pivotal role in the 
EU  derivatives  reporting  regime,  they  already  serve  a  public  purpose  of  providing 
derivatives  data  to  competent  authorities  and  being  a  central  market  infrastructure 
established to improve the transparency of derivatives markets, they are naturally placed 
to play this role. 

29. This being said, ESMA acknowledges that there is still some work to be done with regards 
to  the  quality  of  the  data  reported  to  TRs.  Albeit  the  extensive  guidance  on  reporting 
provided by ESMA and the definition of strict data validation rules, the analysis of the data

11 

 

 

ESMA REGULAR USE 

shows that there are still certain areas (i) where the quality of the data reported needs to 
be improved or (ii) where the reporting practices by market participants need to become 
more  consistent.  Furthermore,  ESMA  also  notes  the  dynamic  nature  of  the  rules  on 
derivatives  reporting  which  is  determined,  among  others,  by  the  appearance  of  new 
derivative  products,  the breadth  of  the  existing  ones, the granularity  of the  details to  be 
reported and by the specificities of the requirements set out by the authorities7. The rules 
on aggregate position data leverage on the rules on reporting and by default might need to 
be updated whenever necessary to ensure alignment with the reporting rules. 

30. ESMA  is  aware  that  the  quality  of  the  aggregate  position  data  published  by  the  TRs  is 
dependent  on  the  quality  of  the  data  reported,  however  ESMA  is  also  certain  that  the 
publication of aggregate data by TRs would allow to address additional data quality issues 
which are only seen at more aggregate level, namely over and under-reporting, incorrect 
identification of the side of the trade or erroneous classification of derivatives, etc. 

31. Last, but not least, an enhanced public data provided by the TRs shows the benefits of the 
EMIR  reporting  framework  where  private  market  infrastructures  were  tasked  to  become 
repositories of transactions and to give access to data to the  authorities, but also to the 
general public. The key points in choosing trade repositories instead of public bodies were 
the inherent flexibility of private entities, the potential scalability of their systems and the 
relevant know-how in data processing.  

32. In  the  Final  report  on  Draft  technical  standards  on  access  to  data  and  aggregation  and 
comparison of data across TR under Article 81 of EMIR8, ESMA defined the operational 
standards  for  aggregation  and  comparison  of  transaction  data  across  TRs.  In  order  to 
ensure that the end users are able to aggregate and compare the aggregate position data 
published by the TRs, ESMA is also defining in this consultation paper the general rules 
for making the data available and is establishing the specific rules to perform aggregations 
at the level of the individual TRs.  

33. In order to address these aspects, stemming from the empowerment under Article 81(5) of 
EMIR  which  requires  ESMA  to  draft  technical  standards  specifying  the  frequency  and 
details of public data, ESMA has drafted the amendments to the RTS on data to be made 
publicly available by TRs to define:  

a.  the frequency and timeliness of publication 

b.  the general technical aspects of aggregation for the purposes of publication 

c. 

the details of aggregations for the purposes of benchmarks’ thresholds  

d.  the details of aggregations for the purposes of trading size of commodity derivatives 

                                                

7   At this stage, CPMI-IOSCO has three work streams on data harmonisation, namely UTI, UPI and critical data elements, which 

would need to be incorporated to the EU reporting rules when finalised

34. Finally,  ESMA  will  be  considering  also  the  feedback  received  on  the  consultation  on 

publication of aggregate data under Regulation 2015/23659. 

3  Avoidance of double counting of cleared transactions for 
the purposes of calculation of aggregate market volumes 

35. The  reporting  of  cleared  transaction  is  provided  in  Article  2  of  Commission  Delegated 
Regulation 148/201310 (current RTS on reporting) and it is further clarified in several ESMA 
EMIR Q&As11. Moreover, the reporting of exchange-trade derivatives (ETDs) is addressed 
in  a  specific  section,  where  two  possible  scenarios  are  depicted.  While  essential  to 
determine  the  risk  exposures  between  the  different  entities  in  the  clearing  chain,  the 
reporting  logic  results  in  additional  numbers  of  transactions  which,  for  the  purposes  of 
market volume and size, need to be addressed. 

36. Similarly, in the case of the OTC transactions, the reporting of the clearing by the CCPs,  
while allowing for swift identification of exposures, practically duplicates the actual volume 
of transactions. 

37. ESMA proposed amendments to the EMIR reporting rules on ETDs which are included in 
paragraph 50 of the Final report on Review of the Regulatory and Implementing Technical 
Standards on reporting under Article 9 of EMIR12 (Amended TS on reporting). In particular, 
when the transaction is concluded on a venue and immediately cleared, it is proposed that 
it is reported only in its cleared form. While this is the general case, there are potentially 
some instances where the clearing might not take place immediately.  

38. The current reporting logic under EMIR does not allow to accurately distinguish in all cases 
between the trades where the CM is clearing for its clients from those where it is clearing 
trades concluded on its own account. 

39. To ensure high quality data and to address risks of misreporting or potential omission of 
information, ESMA has included in its ESMA EMIR Q&As guidance that when one of the 
counterparties to a derivatives contract has several roles in the derivatives transaction, the 
identification of that entity should be included in each of the relevant fields – “Broker ID”, 
“Beneficiary ID”, “Report submitting entity ID”, “Clearing member ID”, “CCP ID”.  

40. Last, but not least, the accuracy and correctness of the aggregation performed by the TRs 
is dependent on (i) how the TRs have implemented the ESMA’s requirements and (ii) how 
the counterparties have reported the data. In case one of those is not accurate enough, 
the actual number would neither be. Particularly in the case of the commodity derivatives,

ESMA REGULAR USE 

in order to allow the TRs to perform consistent and comparable aggregations, it is of utmost 
importance  that  the  counterparties  populate  correctly  and  only  with  monetary  value  the 
field “Notional”. 

3.1  ETDs 

3.1.1  Scope of the data 

3.1.1.1  Determination of Clearing-member-to-client volumes 

41. Usually  ETD  are  cleared  shortly  after  their  conclusion,  hence  under  the  new  TS  on 
reporting  it  is  proposed  that  ETDs  are  reported  only  in  their  cleared  form.  There  are 
potentially some instances where the clearing might not take place immediately. It remains 
unclear  whether  trades  in  the  scope  of  EMIR  concluded  on  venues  outside  the  EU  are 
reported in a consistent manner with the ones concluded on EU venues.   

42. To avoid missing some trades, ESMA considers that given the central role of the CM in 
ETDs, only the transaction where the CM participates should be taken into account. ESMA 
is also aware that at the level of each CM, at least three separate types of accounts, e.g. 
own  trading,  omnibus  client,  segregated  client,  need  to  be kept  in  order to  allow  for  the 
correct operational and regulatory treatment of risks and positions. Therefore, the netting 
at  the  level  of  CCP  is  carried  out  per  each  of  the  separate  accounts  of  the  CM.  The 
derivatives trades concluded by the CM on own account may face the CCP directly or may 
be also versus one of its clients.  

43. To that  extent,  the  transactions  concluded  by  the  CM  with  counterparties  which  are  not 
CCPs, i.e. with the CM’s clients, would need to be taken fully for the purposes of calculation 
of the trading  activity. Furthermore, ESMA would propose that when the TRs aggregate 
ETDs for the purposes of market activity, they include the trades where (a) the field “Venue 
of execution” is not populated with “XXXX” or “XOFF”, (b) where neither counterparty is a 
CCP and (c) where (i) the reporting counterparty is identified as a clearing member or (ii) 
either of the counterparties is also identified as CM for the transaction. Given that in some 
of  the  cases,  the  CM  might  not  be  reporting,  because  it  is  not  subject  to  the  reporting 
obligation under Article 9, ESMA is still exploring which of the two alternatives would give 
more accurate final result. The final requirement on aggregation would take into account 
the feedback received on this aspect. 

 For the purpose of more accurate aggregation of ETD volumes between the CM and 
its clients should only the trades where the CM is reporting counterparty be taken 
into  account  or  should  all  trades  where  CM  is  on  either  side  of  the  ETDs  be 
considered? Please elaborate.

3.1.1.2  Determination of Clearing-member-to-CCP volumes 

44. Furthermore,  it  still  remains  unclear  how  to  add  to  the  trades  descried  in  the  previous 
section the ones that are directly concluded between the CM and the CCP and which are 
not stemming from potentially netted positions of the CM clients.   

45. Option  1  considered  by  ESMA  with  regards  to  aggregation  of  ETDs  is  to  use  the  field 
“Transaction  reference  number”,  which  is  labelled  “Report  tracking  number”  in  the 
amended TS on reporting. While this would have been ESMA’s preferred option, given that 
the field was originally meant to ensure the uniqueness of ETD executions independently 
of the risk exposures, ESMA is aware that this field is currently not populated in a consistent 
way.  Any  potential  aggregation  based  on  this  field  might  produce  results  which  are  not 
accurate.   

46. Option  2  would  be  to  use  “Beneficiary”  field  instead  of  the  field  “Transaction  reference 
number” field. In those cases, where there are trades between the CM and the CCP, the 
CM would need to identify whether it is the beneficiary or whether the beneficiaries are its 
clients. Given that the netting between own trades and client trades is not possible under 
EMIR, the ETD trades relevant for the purposes of aggregation would be clearly identified.  

47. The “Beneficiary” field  is  currently  also  reported  in  a  different  manner.  However, for  the 
purposes of achieving consistency, ESMA understands that Option 2  which uses a field 
which  is  populated  with  a  closed  list  of  values  such  as  LEIs,  would  allow  achieving  the 
objectives of identifying the trades between the CM and the CCP more easily than through 
Option  1  which  uses  a  field  which  is  populated  with  different  number  for  each  single 
execution on a venue.      

48. For the reasons above, Option 1 is considered burdensome at this stage, although ESMA 
would reassess this situation as the EMIR reporting reaches more mature stage. Therefore, 
at this stage, ESMA understands that only option 2 is practically achievable. Any feedback 
to this consultation paper will be considered for the purposes of ensuring consistent ESMA 
guidance on derivatives reporting.  

 For the purpose of more accurate aggregation of ETD volumes between the CM and 
the CCP, is the “Beneficiary ID” the appropriate field or the “Transaction reference 
number/Report tracking number” field should be used? Do you envisage any other 
alternative at this stage? What are the potential costs and benefits of implementing 
any of the proposed options? Please elaborate on the reasons for your response. 

 In general, do you agree with the approach outlined in section 3.1.1 to determine the 
scope  of  the  data  subject  to  aggregation  for  the  purpose  of  calculating  market 
volumes? Please elaborate on the reasons for your response.

3.1.2  Aggregation proposal13 

ESMA REGULAR USE 

49. The  current  rules  on  reporting  require  the  counterparties  to  report  their  new  derivatives 
trades, ETD executions included, with action type “N”. The logic is explained in detail in 
ESMA  EMIR  Q&A  17,  as  well  as  in  the  EMIR  ETD  Q&As.  Under  the  amended  TS  on 
reporting, the counterparties would be allowed to report their original executions with only 
one  action  type  –  action  type  “P”.  The  subsequent  reporting  of  CCP  cleared  positions 
remains unaffected. 

50. Given  that for  the  purposes  of assessing market  activity,  what  is  important  is the  actual 
transaction volume and not where the risks stand, it is essential that the TRs include all the 
underlying transactions between CM and its clients that are reported with action type “N” 
under the current rules on reporting or with action type “P” and where the field “Level” is 
populated with “transaction” under the amended TS on reporting. 

51. The ETDs identified as “Position” should be excluded from the calculations of aggregate 

positions that refer to market volumes.  

52. The identification of the ETDs between CCP and CM would depend on the option taken 
with regards to the identification of trades where the CM is concluding on its own account, 
which are discussed in paragraphs 45-48.  

53. For  the  purposes  of  assessing  ETD  volumes,  after  classifying  the  trades  among  the 
categories defined in paragraph 76 and performing the necessary adjustments detailed in 
that paragraph, the TRs would need to divide by 2 the relevant aggregate positions. This 
mechanism would cater for the actual duplication of the reporting of a single execution on 
the  derivatives  venue  which  is  transformed  into  simultaneous  buy  and  sell  transactions 
versus  the  CCP.  As mentioned  in  paragraph  35,  this  logic  was  introduced  to  be  able  to 
capture the risks in the clearing chain.  

 For the purposes of more accurate aggregation of ETD market volume, do you agree 
with the proposed approach to take into account only the original ETD executions, 
i.e. those that are reported under the current RTS on reporting with action types “N” 
which would be reported under the amended TS on reporting with action type “P”? 
Please elaborate on the reasons for your response. 

 For the purposes of calculating ETD market volume, do you agree with the proposed 
approach to divide by 2 the resulting aggregations in order to cater for the inherent 
duplication  of  trading  volume  of  ETDs?  Please  elaborate  on  the  reasons  for  your 
response. 

                                                

13Among others, the aggregation proposal would rely on the correct reporting by counterparties of the details of the derivatives

ESMA REGULAR USE 

3.2  OTC and XOFF transactions  

54. Differently to the ETDs, where the actual counterparties of the derivative are not in contact 
with  each  other,  in  the  case  of  the  OTC  derivatives  there  is  usually  an  original  bilateral 
transaction  which  is  subsequently  sent  for  clearing.  Hence,  in  the  case  of  the  OTC 
transactions it is expected that by taking only the original bilateral trades, the TRs would 
be able to accurately calculate the volume of market activity. 

55. This can be done by including in the aggregations only the non-cleared trades, i.e. those 
where the field “Venue of execution” is populated with “XXXX” and where the field “Cleared” 
is populated with “No”.  

56. ESMA understands that the derivatives where the field “Venue of execution” is populated 
with XOFF will work in similar way as the OTC trades, with the only practical difference that 
the XOFF would be expected to be cleared in all cases. Therefore, the TRs should include 
in  the  aggregations  only  the  pre-cleared  trades,  i.e.  those  where  the  field  “Venue  of 
execution” is populated with “XOFF” and where the field “Cleared” is populated with “No” 

57. To avoid double counting, only the records with field “Action type“ populated with “New” 

should be included. 

 For the purpose of aggregating more accurately OTC derivatives volume of market 
activity,  do  you  agree  with  the  proposed  approach  to  take  into  account  only  the 
original bilateral OTC and XOFF trades, i.e. those that are reported with action type 
“N”? Please elaborate on the reasons for your response. 

 Do you consider that the approaches outlined in sections 3.1 and 3.2 should be taken 
into  account  for  the  purposes  of  calculating  also  total  volumes  of  reported 
transactions? Please elaborate on the reasons for your response. 

4  General aspects of data aggregation 

4.1  Frequency and timeliness of the publication of data 

58. The frequency of publication of data is one of the aspects where harmonisation is required. 
At the start of the reporting obligation under EMIR, some TRs published data on weekly 
basis, some others on a daily basis. This led to non-comparable figures.  

59. In order to overcome this hurdle in data aggregation, ESMA proposes the publication by 

TRs of aggregate data on a weekly basis. 

60. Each TR should publish data aggregated in accordance with the criteria set out in section 
4.2  by  Tuesday  noon.  The  data  should  take  into  account  all  derivatives  reported  as  of 
23:59:59 UTC on the previous Friday. For the purposes of weekly reporting aggregates, 
the  data  should  include all  derivatives  trades  reported  between  Saturday  00:00:00  UTC 

17 

 

 

ESMA REGULAR USE 

and  Friday  23:59:59  UTC. When  providing  aggregates  on  the  outstanding trades,  those 
would be the ones that remain outstanding as of Friday 23:59:59 UTC. 

 Do  you  agree  with  the  proposed  cut-off  and  publication  times?  If  not,  what  other 
aspects need to be considered? Please elaborate. 

4.2  Operational standards for aggregation and comparison of public 

data 

4.2.1  Scope  of  the  data  to  be  taken  into  account  for  the  purposes  of  general 

aggregations at asset class level 

61. When  performing  the  general  data  aggregations,  the  TRs  should  take  into  account  all 
derivatives reported to them under Article 9 EMIR. In particular, the TRs should include the 
derivatives that are reported at position level. For that purpose, each TRs should ensure 
that when performing data aggregations, it does not count twice the derivatives trades and 
the subsequently reported cleared positions. However, when TRs are required to perform 
specific  aggregations  at class  of  derivatives  level,  as those  outlined  in  sections  5.2  and 
6.2.2, the TRs should take due account of the specificities of the aggregations for those 
trades. 

62. TRs should provide aggregate data per asset class for trades reported in the previous week 

and for outstanding trades as of the relevant cut-off time defined.  

63. In addition, ESMA expects that the TRs include in their internal procedures a reference to 
a process which allows them to correct in timely manner any mistakes on the aggregate 
position data that are being detected.   

 Are there any further specific additional conditions that need to be included? Please 
elaborate on the reasons for your response.  

64. The TR should strive to ensure that the data published is of sufficient quality to allow for 
meaningful aggregations across TRs. As part of the obligations to ensure accuracy of data 
and compliance with the reporting requirements under Article 19 of RTS 150/2013, a TR 
should require the reporting counterparties to amend data which is apparently wrong.  

65. For instance, the TRs could put in place soft checks for identifying outliers. The soft checks 
could be calibrated for specific products, currencies, etc. Standard deviations on normal 
and log-normal distributions could be used. Given the breadth of derivatives, ESMA notes 
that identifying outliers is not straight-forward, hence ESMA would welcome any specific 
feedback on this aspect.  

66. In addition, ESMA understands that it is important that the TRs ensure that when outliers 
are removed from the aggregate position data, this is clearly represented. There are two 
potential alternatives. On the one hand, the TRs could publish two different aggregations 
–  one  with  removed  outliers (cleansed  data  aggregation)  and  another one  without  them 

18 

 

 

ESMA REGULAR USE 

(raw  data  aggregation).  Alternatively,  the  TRs  could  publish  only  cleansed  data 
aggregation. 

  Further to products and currencies, what other data elements need to be taken 
into  account  to  correctly  identify  outliers  from  the  aggregate  position  data?  How 
should the outliers be treated – not at all included in data aggregations or included 
in a raw data aggregation, but removed from a cleansed one? Please elaborate on 
the reasons for your response. 

67. ESMA is also willing to explore to what extent the reconciliation status of derivatives could 
be  taken  into  account.  ESMA’s  preferred  approach  would  be  to  include  only  reconciled 
data  in  the  aggregated  positions  calculated  under  Article  81(5)  of  EMIR.  ESMA 
understands that this would increase the quality and the reliability of public data.  

68. However, ESMA is concerned that the current level of data quality and the high number of 
non-reconciled transaction (also linked to UTI issues) might not allow for the publication of 
significant amount of data reported by the counterparties. From that perspective,  ESMA 
considers to what extent the reconciled and the non-reconciled trades should be provided 
in separate aggregations. 

  Should the reconciliation status be taken into account? Should only reconciled 

trades be included? Please elaborate.  

4.2.2  Types of aggregations per venue of execution 

69. When  performing  aggregations,  the  TRs  should  aggregate  separately  the  derivatives 
taking into account the venue where those are concluded. The practice has showed that 
aggregating OTC and ETD trades as well as exchange traded and traded off exchange 
derivatives has little value from the perspective of a public user.  

70. OTC trades are those for which the Common data field 10 is populated with XXXX and 
XOFF refers to trades on listed derivatives which are traded off-exchange. ETD trades are 
those for which Common data field 10 is populated with a MIC code as per ISO 10383. 
Those MIC that are included in the MIFID Database and pertaining to EEA trading venues 
should be included in the “EEA Venue” aggregation. The rest of MICs should be included 
in the “non-EEA Venue” aggregation.  

71. In that respect and in order to allow for sufficiently granular data, ESMA proposes that the 
TRs  publish  data  classifying  the  trades  based  on  the  common  data  field  ”Venue  of 
execution” as follows:  

a.  Reports where the field “Venue of execution” is populated with “XXXX”, classified 

as OTC 

b.  Reports where the field “Venue of execution” is populated with “XOFF”, classified 

as XOFF 

19 

 

 

ESMA REGULAR USE 

c.  Reports  where  the  field  “Venue  of  execution”  is  populated  with  MIC  code,  in 
accordance with ISO 10383, pertaining to a venue located in the Union, classified 
as EEA MIC 

d.  Reports  where  the  field  “Venue  of  execution”  is  populated  with  MIC  code,  in 
accordance  with  ISO  10383,  pertaining  to  a  venue  located  outside  the  Union, 
classified as non-EEA MIC 

  Do you agree with the suggested aggregation per type of “Venue of execution”? 

4.2.3  Types of quantitative aggregations 

72. The aggregate data to be provided includes the following types of aggregation: 

a.  By  notional,  by  aggregating  the  absolute  value  reported  in  common  data  field  

“Notional”14  

b.  By value, by aggregating the absolute value of the amount reported in counterparty 
data field “Value of the contract”. In case both counterparties have reported to the 
same TR, the TR should take only the value reported by the seller of the derivative. 

c.  By number of contracts, by  aggregating the value reported in common data field 
“Quantity”, except in the case of spreadbets, where the quantity should be taken as 
equal to 1. 

d.  By  number  of  transactions,  by  aggregating  the  unique  transactions  between  two 

counterparties.   

73. Assuming that the reporting counterparties have reported the data on their derivatives and 
CCP  cleared  positions  as  per  the  guidance  included  in  ESMA  EMIR  Q&A  41,  the  TRs 
would simply need to add the relevant notional amounts reported.  

  What other aggregations could be provided? What additional aspects should be 

taken into account? Please elaborate. 

4.2.4  Avoidance of double counting across TRs 

74. Furthermore, to avoid the possible double counting of derivatives across TRs, TRs should 
provide  separate  aggregation  per  derivatives  where  (i)  both  counterparties  report  to the 
same TR, i.e. Dual-sided trades, (ii) only one counterparty reports to the TR and the other 
counterparty also has reporting obligation under EMIR, i.e. single-sided EEA and (iii) only 
one counterparty reports to the TR and the other has no reporting obligation under EMIR, 
i.e. single-sided non-EEA. 

                                                

14 The counterparties should report the data in accordance with the guidance provided in ESMA EMIR Q&A 41.  

20 

 

 

ESMA REGULAR USE 

75. ESMA considers that given that most of the cleared trades are also reported twice, it might 
be  useful to  include  as additional  more granular  level  aggregation  between  cleared  and 
non-cleared derivatives.  

76. The actual categories would be: 

a.  Dual-sided cleared 

b.  Dual sided non-cleared 

c.  Single-sided EEA cleared 

d.  Single-sided EEA non-cleared 

e.  Single-sided non-EEA cleared 

f.  Single-sided non-EEA non-cleared 

77. The quantitative aggregates for all dual-sided trades should be calculated as described in 
paragraphs 72 and 73 and then should be halved to show the actual aggregate per unique 
UTI.  

78. The  aggregates  for  the  different  types  of  single-sided  trades  should  be  performed  as 

defined in paragraphs 72 and 73. 

  Do you agree with the suggested categories? If not, what other aspects should 

be taken into account? Please elaborate on the reasons for your response. 

4.2.5  Accessibility of public data 

79. The accessibility of data should be without restrictions or conditions and downloadable or 
at least enabled to copy. ESMA understands that the data should be available for the public 
for at least 104 weeks. This would allow the relevant users to have access to aggregate 
information for the last 2 years. 

  Should  ESMA  establish  a  longer  period  of  time  for  keeping  publicly  available 
aggregates?  What  are  the  costs  and  benefits  of  a  longer  availability?  Please 
elaborate. 

4.2.6  Format and presentation of public data 

80. The  form  in  which  public  data  is  reported  so  far  by  TRs  is  presented  in  pivoted  tables. 
ESMA considers that for the purpose of facilitating the usage for the public a tabular form 
of report may be more convenient for the purpose of aggregating data from different TRs. 

81. Given  the  wider  target  public,  ESMA  considers  that  it  is  not  necessary  to  include  a 

requirement for publication in xml schema defined in accordance with ISO 20022.  

21 

 

 

ESMA REGULAR USE 

  Should the data made published by the TRs be in pivoted table form or in tabular 

form? What are the potential costs and benefits of each alternative?  

4.2.7  Conversion rates 

82. The  public  aggregate  reports  shall  be  presented  in  Euros.  For  the  purpose  of  currency 
conversion, the relevant exchange rates published by the ECB as of the reference date of 
the provided figures (i.e. Friday) should be used. The exchange rate should be used as 
published, taking into account all the digits after the decimal mark.  

4.2.8  Legacy trades 

83. Some of the trades which are part of aggregations were reported prior to the establishment 
of harmonised data validations and the entry into force of the amended EMIR RTS and ITS 
on reporting. Therefore, it is possible that for some of those trades a TR might not be able 
to accurately classify or even aggregate them. 

84. While  finalising  these  standards,  ESMA  proposes  to  take  into  account  the  relevant 
guidance provided with regards to the reporting of modifications to trades reported prior to 
the entry into force of the amended EMIR RTS on reporting.  

85. ESMA understands that the TRs should provide the aggregate data based on the best use 
that they can make of the data reported to them. In case for some of the aggregations, 
particularly those referring to outstanding trades, it results impossible for a TR to classify 
certain reports, then those should be labelled as “Other”. 

  Do you agree with the proposed treatment of legacy trades? Please elaboarate 

on the reasons for your response.

5  Aggregation on commodity derivatives 

5.1  Aggregation requirement 

87. In order to apply the RTS on ancillary under MiFID II, as explained in section 2.2, market 
participants,  NCAs  and ESMA  would  need  to know  the  market  size  in terms  of  notional 
value traded in the EU, including both on venue and OTC trading, for each of the classes 
of  commodity  derivatives  mentioned  in  RTS  20.  Given  the  granular  and  comprehensive 
derivatives  data  that  TRs  collect  and  their  specialization  on  data  management  and 
processing, they are best placed to publish statistics on the total trading executed per each 
class of commodity derivatives. NCAs would not have access to the necessary information 
to publish market sizes at the EU level and any other alternative to collect and aggregate 
this information would create an unnecessary burden and a duplication of costs. 

88. Article 2(1) of the draft RTS 20 establishes thresholds for the assessment of trading activity 

on the following classes of commodity derivatives: 

a.   metals;  

b.  oil and oil products; 

c.  coal; 

d.  gas; 

e.  power;  

f.  agricultural products;   

g.  other commodities, including freight and commodities referred to in Section C 10 of 

Annex I to Directive 2014/65/EU;  

h.  emission allowances or derivatives thereof. 

89. It is further stated that “the overall market trading activity in each of the asset classes shall 
be calculated by aggregating the gross notional value of all contracts that are not traded 
on a trading venue within the relevant asset class to which any person located in a Member 
State is a party and of any other contract within that asset class that is traded on a trading 
venue located in a Member State.” 

90. Finally, the calculation of the size of the trading activities shall be undertaken annually on 
the  basis  of  a  simple  average  of  the  trading  activities  carried  out  in  the  three  annual 
calculation periods preceding the date of calculation. The calculation of the size of trading 
activities and capital shall commence with trading activities carried out as of 1 July 2016. 
The calculation period starts on 1 July of a given year and ends on 30 June in the following 
year.

5.2  Commodity derivatives aggregation proposal 

91. The  proposal  in  this  Consultation  Paper  requires  trade  repositories  to  aggregate  and 
publish aggregate position data for eight classes of commodity derivatives to enable any 
person wanting to benefit from the MiFID II exemption to identify the total market size from 
the  publications  of  the  various  trade  repositories  and  to  consequently  perform  the 
calculations of their own trading size against those total market sizes to determine whether 
they are in breach of any of the thresholds set in the draft RTS 20. 

92. ESMA  notes  that  the  market  size  aggregate  produced  by  TRs  would  exclude  all  those 
trades where two non-EU counterparties conclude a commodity derivative trade in the EU. 
Nevertheless,  at  this  stage, the  EMIR  aggregations  are  considered  as the  most reliable 
data on overall market size available.  

5.2.1  Scope of the data 

93. The TRs should include in this aggregation only records on commodity derivatives. Under 
the  current  TS  on  reporting,  the  commodity  derivatives  are  identified  either  with  CO  in 
common data field Product ID 1 in the case of OTC derivatives or with CFI codes (O**T** 
or FC****) for ETD. Under the amended TS on reporting the commodity derivatives would 
be reported with value “Commodity” in the common data field “Asset class”.  

94. The relevant classes of commodity derivatives are defined as follows: 

a.  metals – “commodity base” field reported as ‘ME’. 

b.  oil products – “commodity details” reported with ‘OI’ 

c.  coal – “commodity details” reported with ‘CO’ 

d.  gas – “commodity details” reported with ‘NG’ 

e.  power – “commodity details” reported with ‘EL’ or ‘IE’ 

f.  agricultural products – “commodity base” reported with ‘AG’ 

g.  other commodities including freight and C10 – “commodity base” reported with ‘FR’ 

or ‘IN’ or ‘EX’ or ‘OT’ or “commodity details” reported with ‘WE’ 

h.  derivatives on emission allowances – “commodity details” reported with ‘EM’. 

95. To avoid double counting, the TRs should include the records that correspond to the criteria 

defined in sections 3.1 and 3.2 of this Consultation Paper. 

96. Given  they  may  not  be  representative  of  actual  trading  activity,  ESMA  has  decided,  on 
balance,  that  the  intragroup  transactions  need  to  be  removed  from  the  calculations,  i.e. 
trades reported with Common data field 38 “Intragroup” reported with “Y”.

  Do  you  foresee  any  potential  issues  with  identifying  correctly  the  data  to  be 
included in the commodity derivatives aggregations? If so, please provide concrete 
examples of cases where you would not be able to identify the trades in scope of the 
aggregation. Please elaborate. 

5.2.2  Aggregations to be performed 

97. To  allow  entities  to  assess  their  trading  activity  against  each  of  the  thresholds,  ESMA 
proposes  that  the  TRs  provide  aggregate  for  all  the  commodity  derivatives  in  the  eight 
classes of commodity derivatives as reported in the relevant commodity derivatives data 
fields, namely common data fields 45 and 46 of the current EMIR TS on reporting 65 and 
66  of  the  amended  EMIR  TS  on  reporting  and  as  detailed  in  paragraph  94  of  this 
consultation paper. 

98. The aggregations per class of commodity derivatives are separate and should be provided 
by  the  TRs  in  addition  to  the  aggregations  at  the  level  of  the  relevant  commodities 
derivatives which use indexes which are discussed in section 6 of this consultation paper. 

99. With  regard  to  granularity  of  information  per  venue  of  execution,  TRs  should  follow  the 
separation per “Venue of execution” type defined in section 4.2.2. More importantly, for the 
purposes of this aggregation, the transactions concluded on non-EEA venues should be 
provided in a separate aggregation. This classification of the venues located outside the 
EEA is independent from the fact whether the venue is covered by an equivalence decision 
of the Commission or not.  

100.  The  division  per  dual-sided  and  single-sided  EEA  and  non-EEA  trades,  used  for 
general public data aggregation is also required for this aggregation. This granularity allows 
to avoid double counting of trades that are reported by both contractual sides. 

101.  The  aggregation  should  be  performed  at  the  level  of  reported  transactions.  The 
aggregate  positions  per  each  class  of  commodity  derivatives  should  cover  only  the 
aggregation per “Notional” and per “Number of transactions”, as defined in section 4.2.3. 

102.  Given the high-level aggregation to be performed, it is not expected that there are any 

potential confidentiality issues around the publication of the aggregates.  

  Do  you  agree  with  the  proposed  types  of  aggregation  of  commodities 
derivatives?  If  not,  what  other  aspects  should  be  taken  into  account?  Please 
elaborate.  

103.  ESMA understands that the TRs already possess the data necessary to perform the 
aforementioned calculations. ESMA is also aware that most of the underlying data quality 
issues related to EMIR reporting are being gradually addressed. ESMA takes into account 
the requirement under Article 80 of EMIR providing that TRs should maintain the records 
of derivatives for at least 10 years after the termination of the derivative contract. From that 
perspective,  ESMA  would  expect  that  the  TRs  would  be  able  to  aggregate  the  data  in 
accordance with the proposals outlined in this section.

Is  there  any  issue  that  could  potentially  prevent  TRs  from  performing 
aggregation on classes of commodity derivatives on historical data reported before 
the  date  of  application  of  the  amended  TS  on  reporting?  Please  provide  concrete 
examples. 

104.  Following the performance of the quantitative data aggregations as detailed in sections 
3.1, 3.2, 4.2.2, 4.2.3 and this specific section, the trade repository should be able to publish 
an  aggregate  number  of  the  relevant  aggregate  positions  per  class  of  commodity 
derivative, which can be them easily aggregated across repositories.  

  Do you foresee any issues in publishing a single aggregate figure per class of 

commodity derivative and a TR in accordance with the aforementioned rules? 

5.2.3  Frequency of publication 

105.  As  mentioned  in  section  5.1,  the  entities  need  to  assess  their  trading  activity  on  an 

annual basis staring form 1 July 2016. 

106.  With regard to frequency of publication of the commodity derivatives aggregation there 
are several alternatives. On the one hand, the publication can be made on a weekly basis 
as defined in section  4.1 of this consultation paper. On the other hand, a lower frequency 
can be allowed, although the data published should comprise all the transactions in the 
relevant period as per the criteria specified in the previous sections.   

107. 

If  a  weekly  frequency  is  established,  then  the  TRs  would  need  to  keep  in  an  easily 
accessible way aggregate data of at least the last 104 weeks. Regardless of the publication 
of data, the TRs would be required to keep an easily accessible form aggregate data that 
cover at least two years of activity. 

  Which alternative, weekly or lower frequency, is more accurate and useful to the 
entities relying on the data? What are the potential costs and benefits of aligning the 
frequency  of  publication  of  commodity  derivatives  data  with  other  data 
aggregations? Please elaborate on the reasons for your response.  

6  Aggregation  of  derivatives 

the  purposes  of 
measurement  of  the  reference  value  of  a  benchmark 
under Benchmarks Regulation 

for 

6.1  Aggregation requirements  

108.  The  BMR  sets  three  categories  of  benchmarks  that  will  be  subject  to  different 
requirements  according  to  their  size  and  nature.  Benchmarks  used  as  a  reference  for 
financial instruments or financial contracts or for the determination of the performance of 
investment funds will be categorised mainly on the basis of the following criteria: 

26 

 

 

ESMA REGULAR USE 

a.  if they have a total value of at least €500bn on the basis of all the range of maturities 
or  tenors  of  the  benchmark,  where  applicable,  or  they  have  a  total  value  of  400 
billion EUR on the basis of all the range of maturities or tenors of the benchmark, 
where applicable, and meet some additional conditions, they will be deemed to be 
“critical benchmarks”15; 

b.  if they have a total value of at least €50bn on the basis of all the range of maturities 
or tenors of the benchmark, where applicable, over a period of six months, they will 
be deemed to be “significant benchmarks”; 

c. 

if  they  have  a  total  value  below  €50bn,  they  will  be  deemed  “non-significant 
benchmarks”. 

109.  As stated in Article 24(3) and article 26(2) of the BMR, an administrator has to notify its 
competent authority when its significant / non-significant benchmark falls below / above the 
threshold of 50 billion EUR. Furthermore, the national authorities would need to supervise 
the assessments made by the administrators and the European Commission would have 
to adopt the relevant implementing acts to establish a list of critical benchmarks. 

110.  Article  3(1)(16)  of  the  BMR  defines  a  financial  instrument  as  any  of  the  instruments 
listed in Section C of Annex I to MiFID II for which a request for admission to trading on a 
trading venue has been made or which are traded on a trading venue or via a systematic 
internaliser.  

111.  For the purpose of the mandate to assess benchmarks under the relevant quantitative 
thresholds referred in Article 20(1) and Article 24(1)(a) of BMR, ESMA was requested by 
the European Commission to provide technical advice on the appropriate measurement of: 

a.  the nominal amount of financial instruments other than derivatives;  

b.  the notional amount of derivatives; and  

c. 

the net asset value of investment funds. 

112.  For all these three elements, the measurement would include both the direct case and 
the case of the indirect reference to a benchmark within a combination of benchmarks. The 
indirect case relates to the nominal amount of the financial instrument / notional amount of 
the derivative / net asset value of the investment fund referencing to a single benchmark 
(within a combination of benchmarks) which is being assessed as critical or significant. 

113.  The  issue  of  determining  these  measures  should  be  considered  together  with  the 
availability  of  the  data  needed  for  the  calculation.  ESMA  completed  an  overview  of  the 
current and upcoming European legislation that could be considered as input data for the 
measurement of the reference value of a benchmark. From that perspective, the notional 

                                                

15   According to Article 3(1)(25) of the BMR, regulated-data benchmarks (as defined under Article 3(1)(24)) are excluded from 

the category of critical benchmarks. 

27 

 

 

ESMA REGULAR USE 

of a derivative as defined under the current RTS on reporting and under the amended TS 
on reporting is fulfilling the requirements for the measurement of the reference value of a 
benchmark. 

114.  Whereas the competent authorities would have access to this data, the main concern 
is  related to the  non-availability  of  these  data  to benchmarks’  administrators. Therefore, 
ESMA proposes to extend the current public data published by trade repositories on their 
websites or online portals to a breakdown of the aggregate open positions per index and a 
breakdown of aggregate transactions volumes per index. 

115.  Some transactions  in the  scope  of  BMR  might  be  concluded  on  venues  or  systemic 
internalisers that are not identified currently with a MIC code. However under RTS 23 on 
reference  data  under  MiFID  II/MIFIR  (RTS  23,  hereinafter),  the  systematic  internalisers 
would  need  to  identify  themselves  also  with  a  Mic  code.  To  the  extent  that  the 
counterparties  report  consistently  their  derivative  strades  concluded  on  a  systematic 
internaliser, it would not be needed  that the TRs publish also aggregate data on the OTC 
trades that reference an index. 

116.  Furthermore, as indicated in paragraph 22 in order to facilitate data aggregations and 
links between the different types of indexes used, ESMA included in its final report on the 
technical  advice  under  Article  20(1)  and  Article  24(1)(a)  of  BMR  a  recommendation  to 
request the benchmark administrators to obtain an ISIN for all their indexes. 

6.2  Aggregation proposal for derivatives that reference indexes   

6.2.1  Scope of the data 

117.  The data to be taken into account for the purposes of this aggregation is the one defined 
in sections 3.1 and 3.2, except the derivatives identified as pure OTC - reported with value 
“XXXX” in field “Venue of execution”, of this consultation paper.  

118.  The derivative trades to be included in this aggregation should be those where under 
the current RTS the field “Underlying” is populated with “I”. The reporting under the current 
RTS on reporting would not allow the correct identification of the rest of indexes. To that 
extent,  the  aggregations  on  indexes  could  only be  performed  once  the amended TS  on 
reporting  become  applicable.  The  derivative  trades  to  be  included  in  this  aggregation 
should be those where Common data field 7 under the amended EMIR ITS on reporting 
“Underlying Identification type” is populated with “X” for index or where common data fields 
“Floating rate of leg 1” or “Floating rate of leg 2” are populated. ESMA considers that would 
uniquely identify all the derivatives where the underlying is an index. This would include: 

a.  Equity  derivatives,  in  particular  those  using  stock  market  indexes  and  dividend 

index 

28 

 

 

ESMA REGULAR USE 

b.  Credit  derivatives,  in  particular  credit  default  swaps  on  indexes  or  total  return 

swaps16 

c.  Commodity derivatives on indexes 

d.  Interest  rate  derivatives,  such  as  interest  rate  swaps  or  derivatives  where  the 

underlying is a bond index 

e.  Currency derivatives, where the underlying is a currency index  

119.  When  performing  the  data  aggregations  for  the  purposes  of  measurement  of 
benchmarks, the trade repositories should make use of the derivatives traded or admitted 
to  trading  on  trading  venues  or  systematic  internalisers  that  reported  to  them  by  the 
counterparties under the current and amended TS standards on reporting under Article 9 
of EMIR and the reference data to be published by ESMA under RTS 23. . 

120.  Where two different indexes are used in a derivative trade, the notional of that derivative 

trade should be taken into account for each of the relevant aggregations per index. 

  Are there any other types of derivatives than those mentioned in paragraph 118 
that  need  to  be  taken  into  account  in  order  to  provide  more  comprehensive 
aggregations  of  derivatives  that  reference  indexes?  Please  provide  concrete 
examples. Please elaborate. 

6.2.2  Aggregations to be performed 

6.2.2.1  Aggregation of derivatives trades where an interest rate index is used 

121.  A trade repository should provide aggregate data per each index used. The index could 

be used either as a floating rate of a derivative contract or as an underlying.  

122. 

In the case of floating rates, ESMA has already provided a closed list of values to be 
reported, hence the identification and aggregation of floating rate interest rate derivatives 
is facilitated. This still leaves open the question on updates of the values included in that 
list. The proposed way forward for data updates  would be made in accordance with the 
governance structure of ISO 20022 messages, which is outlined in paragraph 132.  

123.  From the perspective of index used as underlying, the trade repository should identify 
in advance the relevant ISINs issued for indexes so that it can easily perform aggregations 
at index level. This can be done by making use of the reference data provided in RTS 23. 
For the purposes of interest rate indexes, ESMA has included in RTS 23 the same list of 
allowable  values  as  the  one  provided  for  in  Common  data  fields  55  and  58  under  the 
amended ITS on reporting under EMIR.  

                                                

16 It is worth mentioning that total return swaps would have also an underlying equity index 

29 

 

 

ESMA REGULAR USE 

124. 

It  is  important  that,  when  establishing  the  relevant  links  for  the  purposes  of  data 
aggregations the TRs, validate the data used to identify the relevant derivative using an 
index. This would ensure that the subsequent aggregations are correctly performed. 

125. 

 As mentioned in paragraph 108, in the case of derivatives using interest rate indexes, 
the aggregations should be made across all the maturities and tenors of the same interest 
rate index. Hence it would not be necessary that TRs aggregate the data per each maturity 
or tenor. In that case the TRs are expected to present the data identifying separately each 
index. This aggregation would be different form the one on non-interest rate indexes where 
the aggregation should be at the level of each ISIN.  

126.  The  aggregate  positions  per  each  index  should  cover  only  the  aggregation  per 

“Notional” and per “Number of transactions, as defined in section 4.2.3. 

127.  The rest of practicalities of the actual aggregations are detailed in sections 4 and 6.2.2.4 

. 

  What  practical  issues  would  you  foresee  in  aggregating  data  on  interest  rate 
indexes?  What  mechanisms  should  be  put  in  place  to  ensure  that  a  TR  is  in  a 
possession of accurate reference data to identify derivatives that have an underlying 
interest rate index? How the objective of publishing accurate aggregations can be 
achieved in the most efficient way? Please elaborate  

6.2.2.2  Aggregation of derivative trades where a non-interest rate index is used  

128. 

In the case of the non-interest rate indexes, ESMA understands that at this stage this 
applies only when indexes are used as underlyings17. The amended EMIR TS on reporting 
provide that the index is identified either with (i) an ISO 6166 code, i.e. an ISIN or a (ii) full 
name  of  the  index  as  assigned  by  the  index  provider.  Under  RTS  23  the  entities  are 
required  to  choose  among  the  values  in  the  closed  list  or  use  a  free  text  to  report  this 
information. As mentioned earlier, ESMA included in its final advice under Article 20(1) and 
Article  24(1)(a)  of  BMR  a  recommendation  to  request  the  benchmark  administrators  to 
obtain an ISIN for all their indexes. 

129.  The  most  widely  used  contracts  under  this  classification  are  indicatively  included  in 

paragraph 131 of this consultation paper.  

130.  The objective is that, by using the reference data, the TRs identify and link all the ISINs 
that refer to the same index in order to prepare and calculate all the relevant aggregations 
for that index.  

131.  ESMA understands that the definition and requirements currently included in RTS 23 
under MiFID II might not be sufficient to ensure unique and unambiguous identification of 
the  derivatives  and  there  is  still  a  possibility  that  the  reporting  entities  are  not  providing 

                                                

17 None of the other reporting fields under EMIR refers to indexes

reference  data  in  a  consistent  way.  This  might  lead  to  practical  problems  for  data 
aggregation. In particular, this would affect: 

a.  Equity indexes, such as stock market indexes and dividend indexes, e.g. Eurostoxx 

50, FTSE 100, DAX 30, CAC 40, etc. 

b.  Credit indexes, such as CDX, iTraxx, etc. 

c.  Commodity indexes, such as CCI, etc.  

d.  Bond  indexes,  such  as  Merrill  Lynch  Global  Bond  Index,  Barclays  Capital 

Aggregate index, etc. 

e.  Currency indexes, such as Euro Currency index, etc.  

6.2.2.3 

Identification and linking of derivatives using non-interest rate indexes 

132. 

It is worth mentioning that RTS 23 requires reporting to be made in ISO 20022 template. 
For  the  purpose  of ISO 20022  messaging  standards,  certain  maintenance functions  are 
performed as part of the general governance. In this regard, ESMA considers that gradually 
a  comprehensive  data  catalogue  or  data  dictionary  with  all  the  indexes  used  in  the  EU 
could be built. This would ensure the consistent reporting of the relevant reference data by 
the entities and it will ensure the unique and unambiguous identification and linking of data 
by TRs. 

133.  Given that the accuracy and consistency of reference data is dependent on the data 
reported, ESMA understands that, subject to the implementation of the recommendation 
to  obtain  an  ISIN  for  each  index,  the  benchmark  administrators  would  contribute  to  the 
building of data catalogue to be used for the purposes of data aggregation under EMIR.  

134.  This approach would ensure the production of free of cost data catalogue with the most 
relevant  indexes,  however  the  time  to  complete  the  data  catalogue  might  be  somehow 
extensive,  which  might  lead  to  practical  difficulties  for  competent  authorities  and 
benchmark administrators to assess timely and correctly the information.  

135. 

In  the  particular  case  of  credit  derivatives,  the  notional  amount  used  for  calculation 
should be adjusted by the index factor reported in Common data field 89 in the amended 
EMIR TS on reporting. 

  Do  you  consider  this  approach  feasible?  What  type  of  information  should  be 
provided by the benchmark administrators? Which other entities should be involved 
in the reference  data  collection?  How timely  should  be  the  provision  of  reference 
data to update the ISO 20022 data catalogue? What are the potential costs of such 
solution? Please elaborate. 

  What alternative solutions are available? Please elaborate.

6.2.2.4  General aspects on aggregation of derivatives that reference indexes 

136.  ESMA is also aware that there are certain instances where a basket of indexes is traded 
as relevant underlying of a derivative. In that case the current TS on reporting do not allow 
the  identification  of  the  individual  components,  however  the  amended  TS  on  reporting 
would  allow  such  identification.  ESMA  is  of  the  opinion  that  to  the  extent  that  a  trade 
repository could identify the weightings of the components, those should be used as they 
are. In case the weightings are not available, ESMA has included in its final advice that the 
weightings of the components should be equal. Stemming from this, if a derivative has a 
notional of 1,000,000 and two components, each should be accounted as 500,000.   

  Do you foresee any difficulties in implementing the suggested approach on data 
aggregation  in  the  case  of  baskets?  Please  elaborate  on  the  reasons  for  your 
response.  

137.  Furthermore, Article 81(5) EMIR provides that the draft regulatory technical standards 
shall aim to ensure that the information published by the TRs is not capable of identifying 
a party to any contract.  

138. 

In  order  to  fulfil  this  confidentiality  requirement  and  not  allow  the  identification  of 
individual parties, the breakdown per index to be published has to take into account the 
following limit – publication of the aggregate notional amounts of derivatives using an index 
should take place only for derivatives transactions on indexes where the aggregate notional 
amount  is  at  least  5  billion  and  where  there  are  at  least  6  different  counterparties,  i.e. 
entities with different LEIs involved. In case there are less than 6 different counterparties 
that  have  concluded  derivatives  transactions  in  the  scope  of  this  aggregation,  but  the 
aggregate  notional  amount  is  above,  the  trade  repository  should  include  the  aggregate 
figure together with other aggregations that have similar characteristics in a bucket called 
“Other”.  

 

Is the limit of 5 billion EUR per index and TR, where there are at least 6 different 
counterparties to trades, sufficient to provide the sufficient transparency over those 
transactions, while not undermining the confidentiality of the data? Please elaborate 
on the reasons for your response. 

139.  The  trade repository  should  be  able to  publish  an  aggregate  number  of the  relevant 
aggregate  positions  for  derivatives  that  reference  indexes,  where  the  field  “Venue  of 
execution” is populated with “XOFF” and an “EEA MIC”, as those are defined in section 
4.2.2. 

140.  Following the performance of the quantitative data aggregations as detailed in section 
3.1, 3.2, 4.2.2 and 4.2.3, the trade repository should be able to publish also an aggregate 
number  of  the  relevant  aggregate  positions  for  each  index,  which  can  be  them  easily 
aggregated across repositories.  

  Do you foresee any issues in publishing a single aggregate figure per index and 

a TR in accordance with the aforementioned rules?

provided, as detailed in section 4.1.

  For the purpose of more accurate aggregation of ETD volumes between the CM and its 
clients should only the trades where the CM is reporting counterparty be taken into account or 
should all trades where CM is on either side of the ETDs be considered? Please elaborate. 

  For the purpose of more accurate aggregation of ETD volumes between the CM and 
the  CCP,  is  the  “Beneficiary  ID”  the  appropriate  field  or  the  “Transaction  reference 
number/Report tracking number” field should be used? Do you envisage any other alternative 
at this stage? What are the potential costs and benefits of implementing any of the proposed 
options? Please elaborate on the reasons for your response. 

  For the purposes of more accurate aggregation of ETD market volume, do you agree 
with the proposed approach to take into account only the original ETD executions, i.e. those 
that  are  reported  under  the  current  RTS  on  reporting  with  action  types  “N”  which  would  be 
reported under the amended TS on reporting with action type “P”? Please elaborate on the 
reasons for your response. 

  For the purposes of calculating ETD market volume, do you agree with the proposed 
approach to divide by 2 the resulting aggregations in order to cater for the inherent duplication 
of trading volume of ETDs? Please elaborate on the reasons for your response. 

  For  the  purpose  of  aggregating  more  accurately  OTC  derivatives  volume  of  market 
activity, do you agree with the proposed approach to take into account only the original bilateral 
OTC and XOFF trades, i.e. those that are reported with action type “N”? Please elaborate on 
the reasons for your response. 

  Do you consider that the approaches outlined in sections 3.1 and 3.2 should be taken 
into account for the purposes of calculating also total volumes of reported transactions? Please 
elaborate on the reasons for your response. 

  Do you agree with the proposed cut-off and publication times? If not, what other aspects 

need to be considered? Please elaborate. 

  Are  there  any  further  specific  additional  conditions  that  need  to  be  included?  Please 

elaborate on the reasons for your response. 

  Further  to  products  and  currencies,  what  other  data  elements  need  to  be  taken  into 
account to correctly identify outliers from the aggregate position data? How should the outliers 
be treated – not at all included in data aggregations or included in a raw data aggregation, but 
removed from a cleansed one? Please elaborate on the reasons for your response. 

  Should the reconciliation status be taken into account? Should only reconciled trades 

be included? Please elaborate. 

  Do you agree with the suggested aggregation per type of “Venue of execution”? 
  What other aggregations could be provided? What additional aspects should be taken 

into account? Please elaborate. 

  Do you agree with the suggested categories? If not, what other aspects should be taken 

into account? Please elaborate on the reasons for your response. 

  Should  ESMA  establish  a  longer  period  of  time  for  keeping  publicly  available 

aggregates? What are the costs and benefits of a longer availability? Please elaborate. 

  Should the data made published by the TRs be in pivoted table form or in tabular form? 

What are the potential costs and benefits of each alternative?

  Do you agree with the proposed treatment of legacy trades? Please elaboarate on the 

reasons for your response. 

  What other aspects should be taken into account for the purposes of publication of data? 

Please elaborate. 

  Do you foresee any potential issues with identifying correctly the data to be included in 
the  commodity  derivatives  aggregations?  If  so,  please  provide  concrete  examples  of  cases 
where  you  would  not  be  able  to  identify  the  trades  in  scope  of  the  aggregation.  Please 
elaborate. 

  Do you agree with the proposed types of aggregation of commodities derivatives? If not, 

what other aspects should be taken into account? Please elaborate. 

  Is there any issue that could potentially prevent TRs from performing aggregation on 
classes of commodity derivatives on historical data reported before the date of application of 
the amended TS on reporting? Please provide concrete examples. 

  Do  you  foresee  any  issues  in  publishing  a  single  aggregate  figure  per  class  of 

commodity derivative and a TR in accordance with the aforementioned rules? 

  Which alternative, weekly or lower frequency, is more accurate and useful to the entities 
relying  on  the  data? What  are  the  potential  costs  and  benefits  of  aligning  the  frequency  of 
publication of commodity derivatives data with other data aggregations? Please elaborate on 
the reasons for your response. 

  Are there any other types of derivatives than those mentioned in paragraph 117 that 
need  to  be  taken  into  account  in  order  to  provide  more  comprehensive  aggregations  of 
derivatives that reference indexes? Please provide concrete examples. Please elaborate. 

  What practical issues would you foresee in aggregating data on interest rate indexes? 
What mechanisms should be put in place to ensure that a TR is in a possession of accurate 
reference  data  to  identify  derivatives  that  have  an  underlying  interest  rate  index?  How  the 
objective  of  publishing  accurate  aggregations  can  be  achieved  in  the  most  efficient  way? 
Please elaborate 

  Do you consider this approach feasible? What type of information should be provided 
by  the  benchmark  administrators? Which  other  entities  should  be  involved  in  the  reference 
data collection? How timely should be the provision of reference data to update the ISO 20022 
data catalogue? What are the potential costs of such solution? Please elaborate. 

  What alternative solutions are available? Please elaborate. 
  Do  you  foresee  any  difficulties  in  implementing  the  suggested  approach  on  data 

aggregation in the case of baskets? Please elaborate on the reasons for your response. 

  Is  the  limit  of  5  billion  EUR  per  index  and  TR,  where  there  are  at  least  6  different 
counterparties  to  trades,  sufficient  to  provide  the  sufficient  transparency  over  those 
transactions,  while  not  undermining the confidentiality  of  the  data?  Please  elaborate  on  the 
reasons for your response. 

  Do you foresee any issues in publishing a single aggregate figure per index and a TR 

in accordance with the aforementioned rules?

7.4  Annex IV 

Cost-benefit analysis 

ESMA’s  choices  in  this  review  are  of  a  pure  technical  nature  and  do  not  imply  strategic 
decisions or policy choices.  

ESMA’s  options  are  limited  to  the  approach  it  took  to  drafting  these  particular  regulatory 
technical standards and the need to ensure harmonised and standardised aggregate data and 
to provide greater value of the data which is reported under EMIR. 

The  main  policy  decisions  have  already  been  analysed  and  published  by  the  European 
Commission taken under the secondary legislation, i.e. EMIR.  

The impact of such policy decisions has already been taken into account when drafting the 
technical standards on reporting to trade repositories, including the ones being amended, and 
may be found under the following link: 

http://www.esma.europa.eu/system/files/2012-379.pdf 

As mentioned in sections 2.2 and 2.3, there are two EU regulations, in particular MiFID II and 
BMR, which require the use of EU aggregate derivatives data for different incumbent entities. 
In one case, MiFID II provides that market participants assess their trading volumes in certain 
classes  of  commodity  derivatives.  In  the  other  case,  BMR  establishes  that  index  providers 
assess  the  significance  of  their  respective  indexes  vis-à-vis  a  threshold  established  in  the 
BMR. In the absence of TR data these entities would need to run complex and costly processes 
to  compile  the  data  across  all  the  different  venues  and  post-trade  providers.  Clearly  this 
process  would  not  be  error-free  and  it  is  highly  possible  that  there  will  be  different  figures 
obtained by each entity. This would run contrary to the objectives of the regulations and would 
create unlevelled playing field.  

From the perspective of the supervisory authorities such situation would significantly hamper 
the fulfilment of their duties. In case the authorities are required to recreate the aggregations 
from  the  derivatives  data  to  which  they  have  access,  it  will  be  impossible  to  compare  the 
results,  since  every  authority  have  different  access  levels  based  on  its  responsibilities  and 
mandates. In case it would be for ESMA to perform these aggregations, such task would be 
overly  burdensome  and,  most  importantly,  ESMA  would  lack  the  direct  contact  with  the 
reporting  entities  should  any  amendments  to  the  underlying  data  be  needed.  TRs  result  a 
natural choice in this regard as they play pivotal role in the EU derivatives reporting regime.  

Last, but not least, an enhanced public data provided by the TRs shows the benefits of the 
EMIR  reporting  framework  where  private  market  infrastructures  were  tasked  to  become 
repositories of transactions and to give access to data to the authorities, but also to the general 
public. The key point in choosing trade repositories instead of public bodies was the inherent 
flexibility of private entities, the potential scalability of their systems and also the relevant know-
how in data processing.

ESMA REGULAR USE 

ESMA understands that the main costs attached to the changes required in this RTS will be 
borne by Trade Repositories and authorities, and thus ESMA requests precise estimates from 
them in the context of public consultation. ESMA expects to gather further information on the 
cost-benefit  analysis  of  the  proposed  amendments  based  on  the  evidence  and  feedback 
received.
