1 Executive Summary
Reasons for publication
The European Commission proposed draft Regulation on indices used as benchmarks in
financial instruments and financial contracts1 (Benchmarks Regulation) in September 2013
in the wake of the manipulation of various benchmarks.
On 24 November 2015, the European Parliament and the Council reached a preliminary
political agreement2 on a compromise text of the Benchmarks Regulation, an agreement
that was confirmed on 9 December 2015 by the Permanent Representatives Committee of
the Council of the European Union3. The European Parliament voted and approved the text
of the Benchmarks Regulation in its plenary session on the 28 April 2016. The Benchmarks
Regulation4 has been published in the Official Journal of the European Union on the 29 June
2016 and entered into force the following day.
The Benchmarks Regulation requires ESMA to develop a number draft regulatory and
implementing technical standards to be submitted to the Commission by 1 April 2017.
ESMA published a Discussion Paper5 (DP) on the Benchmarks Regulation on 15 February
2016. The DP included ESMA’s policy orientations and initial proposals for both the draft
technical standards and the technical advice to the Commission6.
This Consultation Paper (CP) is the follow-up of the DP with respect to ESMA’s draft
technical standards.

Contents
This CP is organised in ten chapters, each dedicated to one of the areas for which the
Benchmarks Regulation requested ESMA to develop draft technical standards, namely: (i)
procedures, characteristics and positioning of oversight function, (ii) appropriateness and
verifiability of input data, (iii) transparency of methodology, (iv) specification of elements of
the code of conduct of contributors, v) governance and control requirements for supervised
contributors, (vi) specification of qualitative criteria for significant benchmarks, (vii) template
for compliance statement for significant/non-significant benchmarks, (viii) contents of
benchmark statement, (ix) information to be provided in applications for authorisation and
registration, and (x) form and content for the application for recognition by third country
administrators. Each chapter summarises the relevant provisions and their objectives,
provides an explanation of the related policy issues and references to the relevant responses
received to the DP. The CP also includes a first version of each draft technical standard and
a preliminary high-level cost-benefit analysis.

6

Next Steps
ESMA will consider the responses to this CP, and will finalise the draft technical standards
in order to submit them to the Commission before the 1 April 2017.

Characteristics and procedures of the oversight
function (Article 5 BMR)

2.1

Mandate

Article 5
5. ESMA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify the procedures regarding
the oversight function and the characteristics of the oversight function including its
composition as well as its positioning within the organisational structure of the administrator,
so as to ensure the integrity of the function and the absence of conflicts of interest. In
particular, ESMA shall develop a non-exhaustive list of appropriate governance
arrangements as laid down in paragraph 4.
ESMA shall distinguish between the different types of benchmarks and sectors as set out in
this Regulation and shall take into consideration the differences in the ownership and control
structure of administrators, the nature, scale and complexity of the provision of the
benchmark, and the risk and impact of the benchmark, also in light of international
convergence of supervisory practice in relation to governance requirements of benchmarks.
However, the ESMA draft regulatory technical standards shall not cover or apply to
administrators of non-significant benchmarks.
ESMA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 1 April
2017.
Power is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred
to in the first subparagraph in accordance with the procedure laid down in Articles 10 to 14
of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.

2.2

General remarks

1. Under Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 – the Benchmarks Regulation (BMR) – administrators
of all benchmarks falling within the scope of Title II are required to establish a permanent
and effective oversight function for all aspects of the provision of its benchmarks. The BMR
sets out the minimum responsibilities and characteristics which administrators must
introduce in order to ensure oversight of all aspects of the provision of their benchmarks.
2. In that context, ESMA is required to draft regulatory technical standards (RTS) to specify
the detailed procedures and characteristics of oversight functions – in particular the
positioning of a function within the organisation of the administrator and the composition of
an oversight function, including a non-exhaustive list of governance arrangements. Under
the BMR, the RTS must ensure the integrity of the oversight function and the absence of

8

conflicts of interest at the level of the administrator. The RTS do not however apply to the
oversight functions of non-significant benchmarks or of interest rate benchmarks.
3. The BMR allows for a proportional application of the requirements for the oversight function
at Level 1. ESMA also considers the mandate regarding composition to be flexible as it
allows administrators to select the structure most appropriate to their businesses. For these
reasons, ESMA has determined that there are few possibilities to introduce further
proportionality in the RTS. However, ESMA recognises that the level of scrutiny required
by infrequently used significant benchmarks may not be equal to that required by critical
benchmarks. In that context, ESMA has introduced a number of provisions aimed at
addressing the specific needs of different types of benchmarks which are dealt with under
sections 2.3 (characteristics) and 2.4 (procedures) below.
4. Based on the mandate set out in the BMR, ESMA has developed draft RTS on the following
specific characteristics: positioning and composition, including the non-exhaustive list of
governance arrangements that are appropriate for an oversight function. ESMA notes that
there is scope within the mandate to specify additional characteristics of the oversight
function, as ESMA is required to “specify the characteristics of the oversight function
including its composition as well as its positioning within the organisational structure of
the administrators so as to ensure the integrity of the function and the absence of conflicts
of interest”. ESMA considers however that the issues covered by the draft RTS are
sufficient to address the mandate set out at Level 1.
5. In response to ESMA’s initial discussion paper (DP), a number of respondents highlighted
concerns which ESMA believes are beyond the scope of the mandate for the RTS.
Regarding the responsibilities of the oversight function – in particular annual reviews of
methodologies by benchmark, oversight of third parties and taking action on breaches of
the code of conduct – these are set out in the BMR and cannot be amended by the RTS.
Recognising the role of the oversight function in reducing conflicts of interest at the level of
the administrator, another respondent requested that the concept of “independent
administration” be recognised as an alternative way of managing conflicts of interest.
However, this is not within the scope of the characteristics and procedures of the oversight
function; rather it could be considered within the context of conflicts of interest management
at the level of the administrator under Article 4 of the BMR, which is not covered by these
RTS.

2.3

Characteristics of the oversight function

Composition
6. The majority of the respondents to the DP have already established a committee to operate
as their oversight function, in order to meet the demands of the IOSCO Principles for
Financial Benchmarks, the EBA/ESMA Principles for Benchmarks-setting processes and,
in some cases, domestic regulation. Some respondents stated that they operate multiple
committees as part of their oversight functions, with each committee either responsible for
9

different benchmarks or for different tasks. ESMA has attempted to minimise the burden
on administrators that would be involved in overhauling an already fit-for-purpose function
by ensuring that the administrator has discretion over the structure most appropriate for
their business. For example, where an administrator has in place a pre-existing committee
which fulfils the responsibilities of the oversight function, it may be appropriate to nominate
that committee as the oversight function. ESMA notes however that the competent
authority of the administrator is tasked with the authorisation and supervision of the
administrator, including the structure of its oversight function. The competent authority will
therefore seek to ensure that the structure of the oversight function is appropriate to the
benchmarks provision process at all times and may challenge the decisions of the
administrator where necessary.
7. The BMR recognises the need to provide the administrator with flexibility in selecting the
structure of the oversight function most suitable to its business, insofar as ESMA is required
to establish a non-exhaustive list of governance arrangements appropriate for the oversight
function to meet its responsibilities under Level 1. This non-exhaustive list, as well as the
confirmation that the composition of the oversight function should be at the discretion of
the administrator, was met with approval by a large proportion of respondents to the DP.
While the structures included in the non-exhaustive list in the draft RTS have been
somewhat amended to address concerns raised by respondents, the flexibility of the DP
has been retained.
8. Many of the governance arrangements proposed in the non-exhaustive list take the form
of a committee or a number of committees - reflecting the reality at most of the
administrators that responded to the DP. Half of the respondents were in favouring of
exercising oversight over benchmarks grouped together based on the underlying interest
they seek to measure, while the other half supported the tailoring of oversight based on
whether the benchmark is critical or significant. ESMA has taken the views that the
possibility to establish an oversight function consisting of multiple committees will enable
an administrator to select individuals with expertise tailored to a particular benchmark,
while maintaining centralised oversight of all benchmarks. Most respondents were in favour
of the option of having one oversight function for all their benchmarks; however, some
respondents noted that they operate multiple committees which carry out separate tasks
and together form the oversight function for specific benchmarks. ESMA considers that
such a structure would also meet the requirements of Level 1 and it has been included in
the non-exhaustive list.
9. Natural persons are permitted to operate as the oversight function under the draft RTS,
except in the case of critical benchmarks or regulated data benchmarks used in financial
contracts, financial instruments or investments funds having a total value greater than EUR
500 billion. It is expected that such a structure would be most appropriate for example in
the case of an administrator that provides only a small number of benchmarks that are not
widely used, or for benchmarks that are based entirely on readily available data, be it
regulated or not, and are not widely used. The number of respondents to the DP in support
of this proposal outnumbered those opposed. Concerns around continuity were at the root
of the objections. ESMA has determined that it is necessary to retain the option of natural
10

persons operating as the oversight function to maintain proportionality in the requirements.
ESMA considers that continuity can be maintained through record keeping and knowledge
management, which are required as part of the rules on positioning of the oversight function
and the procedures to be designed by the administrator. In order to ensure proportional
application of the rules, ESMA has determined that the natural person can be an employee
of the administrator or an external person contracted by the administrator for the purpose
of carrying out the responsibilities of the oversight function. Such a person should not have
a vested interest in the benchmark and would not be otherwise already employed by the
administrator. ESMA would expect this option to be selected by administrators with a small
workforce and staff who are not directly involved in the provision of the benchmark are not
available.
10. The proposal which was met with the most opposition by respondents to the DP was the
suggestion that independent members should be included in the oversight function for
certain types of benchmarks. ESMA considered independent members to be either natural
persons that are not directly affiliated with the administrator, or independent non-executive
directors. The purpose of this proposal was to ensure appropriate management of the
conflicts of interest which may arise at the level of the administrator, for example due to
the administrator’s ownership structure, controlling interests or other activities – consistent
with Article 4(3) of the BMR. Independent members may also help to maintain objectivity
in oversight where a number of different stakeholders with competing interests are acting
as members of the oversight function. ESMA considers that independent members are
most pertinent for benchmarks that have been designated as critical.
11. Approximately a third of respondents objected to any requirement to include independent
members in the oversight function. Most were concerned that the introduction of individuals
not affiliated with the administrator would introduce new conflicts where there previously
were none. Some respondents opposed the possibility of including independent executive
directors (INEDs) in particular, as they felt that this would blur the lines between the
oversight function and the management body of the administrator. In response to the
objections from respondents regarding the independence of INEDs from the management
body of the administrator, ESMA has removed this element in favour of independent
members only. Independent members are described as persons who are not otherwise
directly affiliated with the administrator and who do not have a vested interest in the
benchmark. Contributors and users are not therefore considered to be independent
members.
12. Many respondents stressed the need for the oversight function to be composed of
members with expertise appropriate to the benchmarks they are overseeing and ESMA
has sought to reflect this in the draft RTS – both as part of the requirements for composition
and in the procedures for the oversight function. ESMA takes the view that although
external parties, such as users and contributors, may bring conflicts of interest to the
oversight function, they can also provide vital expertise. Some respondents expressed
unease at the prospect of being required to include users, contributors and other
stakeholders in their oversight functions. A few felt that the inclusion of contributors could
compromise the independence of the oversight function, others stated that users could
11

represent their own interests, rather than the markets, and some felt that any such
requirements would go beyond the scope of the BMR. ESMA has determined that in order
to reflect the spirit of the BMR, administrators are permitted, but not required, to invite
external stakeholders to join their oversight function. Provisions for managing any
associated conflicts of interest that may arise are included in the draft RTS. A few
respondents also noted that they maintain advisory committees to consult the views of
external stakeholders, rather than including them in the oversight function. This option has
been reflected in the procedures for managing conflicts of interest within the oversight
function.
13. Some respondents to the DP requested specific treatment for regulated data benchmarks
and commodities benchmarks subject to Title II of the BMR. ESMA has determined that
the flexible nature of the composition requirements, which allow the administrator to select
the oversight function most appropriate to their business, should provide sufficient
proportionality for administrators of commodities and regulated data benchmarks. In order
to account for the specific natures of these benchmarks however, ESMA has proposed that
administrators of regulated data benchmarks should consider including representatives of
their input data sources as members of their oversight functions. Administrators of
commodities benchmarks subject to Title II are, as is the case for all administrators
providing benchmarks based on contributions, asked to consider including representatives
of their contributors – supervised and non-supervised – as members of their oversight
functions. ESMA would like to stress that administrators should consider but are not
required to include these individuals as members, with the caveat that the composition of
the oversight function is subject to the supervision of the administrator’s competent
authority.
14. Taking into account the concerns raised regarding the inclusion of external stakeholders
as members, ESMA has considered it appropriate to retain the possibility for an
administrator to establish a committee without external stakeholders. This proposal was
supported by a number of respondents to the DP. Some respondents stated that they
consider staff involved solely in areas such as legal and compliance to be sufficiently
removed from benchmark provision to fulfil the role of independent members. In order to
safeguard the integrity of the oversight, ESMA has proposed that staff of the administrator
who are not involved in the provision of the benchmark must be included as members.
Where it is necessary to establish a committee and the staff in question are not available,
ESMA has taken the view that independent persons must be included as members of the
oversight function.
15. In their responses to the DP, administrators discussed the structure of their existing
oversight functions. In some cases, respondents stated that employees involved in
benchmarks provision act as members of the oversight function, although these employees
often do not have voting rights. ESMA has sought to reflect this reality in the draft RTS.
16. ESMA has also introduced the concept of observers into the draft RTS. Observers would
not be permanent members of the oversight function and would be permitted to attend
meetings, without voting rights, at the discretion of the oversight function only. The purpose
12

of observers is to allow the oversight function to benefit from additional expertise, in
particular from public authorities from the EU and third countries that are not competent
authorities under the BMR. However, market participants and others stakeholders could
also act as observers.
Q1: Do you consider the non-exhaustive list of governance arrangements to be
sufficiently flexible? Are there any other structures which you would like to see
included?
Q2: Do you support the option for the oversight function to be a natural person who is
not otherwise employed by the administrator?
Q3: Do you support the concept of observers and their inclusion in the oversight
function?

Positioning
17. ESMA’s DP envisaged an oversight function that is embedded within an administrator’s
organisational structure and would be able to effectively challenge the management body7
of the administrator with regards to decisions on the provision of the benchmark. Under the
BMR, the administrator – in particular its management body – is ultimately responsible for
decisions around the benchmarks provision process. However, ESMA takes the view that
the BMR requires the oversight function to act independently of the administrator in certain
instances in order to fulfil its obligations. This is especially relevant in cases of misconduct
at the administrator, as the oversight function is required to report such misconduct to the
competent authority. ESMA therefore considers, contrary to the assertions of a few
respondents, that the oversight function is not simply a consultative body.
18. A large majority of respondents supported the positioning of the oversight function as being
embedded within the organisation of the administrator, stating that they believe this will
facilitate effective challenge of the administrator with regards to the provision of the
benchmark. ESMA has reflected this view in the draft RTS, and has highlighted the need
for the oversight function to be able to provide effective scrutiny of the administrator. Some
respondents stated that they believe that the role of the oversight function should be
focused on the oversight of governance arrangements, rather than challenging the
administrator. ESMA agrees that the oversight function must oversee the governance
arrangements of the administrator, but ESMA is also confident that this is not possible
without the ability to challenge the decisions of the administrator with regards to the
benchmarks provision process.

7

As defined in Article 3(1)(20) of Regulation (EU) 2016/1011.

13

19. ESMA considers that the oversight function must be able to act independently of the
administrator in order to fulfil the following responsibility:


reporting to the relevant competent authorities any misconduct by contributors,
where the benchmark is based on input data from contributors, or
administrators, of which the oversight function becomes aware, and any
anomalous or suspicious input data (article 5(3)(i)).

20. ESMA’s view is that independence of the oversight function is essential to allow reporting
of misconduct to the competent authority. However, in all other respects, ESMA expects
the oversight function to make recommendations to the administrator and to be able to
record, but not take action on, any diversion of the administrator from those
recommendations.
21. Almost all respondents agreed with ESMA that the oversight function should not have any
oversight of the business decisions of the management body of the administrator, noting
that administrators often form part of a wider business group. A couple of respondents
expressed a preference for greater flexibility on this point. ESMA has determined that the
management body and the oversight function should be separate, although the oversight
function may invite members of the administrator’s management body to attend its
meetings (see Article 1(7) and Article 2(2) of the draft RTS).
22. A couple of respondents requested that the oversight function be separated internally from
the rest of the business to avoid conflicts of interest. ESMA considers that this is
appropriately dealt with in the draft RTS regarding the composition as staff of the
administrator involved in the provision of the benchmark or any related activities are not
permitted to be voting members of the oversight function. Conflicts of interest stemming
from the wider business should be managed appropriately under the requirement for
operation separation in Article 4(2) of the BMR.
23. A small number of respondents requested a clearly defined relationship between the
management and the oversight function – some going so far as to suggest that the
administrator be allowed to delegate decisions to the oversight function. ESMA considers
this latter point to be beyond the scope of the mandate of the RTS.

2.4

Procedures regarding the oversight function

24. ESMA considers that the procedures set out in the draft RTS should apply to all
benchmarks to ensure consistency across the market in the application of the BMR.
However, oversight functions carried out by a natural person in accordance with paragraph
3 of the Annex of the RTS are exempt from certain procedures that would only be
appropriate for a committee. The administrator will nonetheless have to ensure that such
a natural person is not subject to conflicts of interest. The procedures in the draft RTS set
out the minimum ESMA would expect and administrators are not restricted from introducing
additional procedures appropriate to their benchmarks. Of the respondents who addressed
14

the need for differentiation between types of benchmarks, most did not see the need for
different procedures.
25. ESMA only received two objections to the list of procedures proposed in the DP, which
were focused on the requirement to publish the names of members of the oversight
function. The respondents were concerned about the impact the publication requirement
could have on the integrity of the function. ESMA has removed this requirement from its
list of minimum procedures, although administrators are not prohibited from publishing the
details, if they so choose. ESMA has also expanded the list of procedures originally
envisaged in the DP, in response to feedback received from respondents and following
further discussion at ESMA. In addition to the terms of reference, the criteria to select
members, conflicts of interest declaration and processes for electing committee members,
ESMA has added the following additional procedures in response to feedback to the DP:
frequency of meetings; procedures for recording, redacting and publishing meeting
minutes to ensure transparency of the work of the oversight function; criteria for selecting
members based on their expertise; establishment of ethical policies, escalation and
whistleblowing procedures; and determining terms of appointment for members.
26. Following further discussion of the Task Force, ESMA has also proposed the following
additional procedures:


criteria to identify oversight function observers in case external entities, for
example public authorities which are not competent authorities under the
Regulation seek to join or are invited by the oversight function;



procedures for managing the involvement of staff of the administrator
responsible for the provision of the benchmarks and of observers in the work of
the oversight function, as the former are non-voting members and the latter,
non-permanent;



coordination of the oversight function when it consists of multiple committees or
sub-functions, to guarantee centralised oversight;



dispute resolution mechanism to ensure the enforcement of the procedures and
to allow for the effective fulfilment of the responsibilities of the oversight
function;



processes governing the actions the oversight function must take independently
of the administrator, in order to fulfil the responsibilities set out in the Regulation;



management of the interaction between the oversight function and the
management; and



arrangements to safeguard the confidentiality of the work of the oversight
function, where information cannot be publically disclosed.

15

27. Some respondents suggested that the remuneration of oversight function members should
be transparently reported. ESMA has taken the view that such a requirement would not be
proportionate and would potentially limit the ability of administrators to locate individuals
willing to join the oversight function. The proposal has not been included in the draft RTS.
28. ESMA’s DP noted that conflicts of interest may arise in the oversight function, in particular
due to the vested interest of contributors in the benchmark. The DP also discussed the
procedures to manage conflicts of interest arising from the composition of the oversight
function. The majority of respondents agreed that individuals with possible conflicts of
interest should not be prevented from joining oversight functions, provided that their
conflicts of interest can be appropriately managed. Respondents believed that external
stakeholders – in particular the example of contributors which was raised in the DP – should
be prevented from joining an oversight function only if: their conflicts of interest cannot be
managed; the individual in question is charged with financial services-related offences; or
the person serves on the committee of another administrator. Respondents also stated that
contributors in particular should be excluded from meetings of the oversight function if the
meeting agenda included a discussion on the conduct of the contributors. Those objecting
to the inclusion of contributors and other stakeholders, echoed the concerns raised in the
discussion regarding composition – namely that the inclusion of such individuals would
introduce conflicts of interest where there previously were none.
29. Respondents to the DP proposed a variety of different procedures for managing conflicts
of interest in the oversight function. ESMA has incorporated the majority of these proposals
into the draft RTS. ESMA has rejected the proposal to prohibit external parties from voting
and does not mandate or prohibit the provision of voting rights to external members.

Q4: Do you think that the draft RTS allows for sufficient proportionality in the application
of the requirements? If no, please explain why and provide proposals for introducing
greater proportionality.
Q5: Do you have any other comments on the oversight function (composition,
positioning and procedures) as set out in the draft RTS?

Draft technical standards: Oversight function

COMMISSION DELEGATED REGULATION (EU) No …/2017
of XXX
[…]
supplementing Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 of the European Parliament and of the
Council with regard to regulatory technical standards for the procedures and
characteristics of the oversight function
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EU) No 2016/1011 of the European Parliament and of the Council
of 8 June 2016 on indices used as benchmarks in financial instruments and financial contracts
or to measure the performance of investment funds and amending Directives 2008/48/EC and
2014/17/EU and Regulation (EU) No 596/20148, and in particular Article 5(5) thereof,
Whereas:
(1)

The list of structures set out in this Regulation is intended to be non-exhaustive, in
compliance with the mandate under paragraph 5 of Article 5 of Regulation (EU) No
2016/1011. Administrators are allowed discretion to select the oversight function most
appropriate for the benchmarks provided and are not restricted to establishing an
oversight function based on the structures listed.

(2)

External stakeholders acting as members of an oversight function can provide valuable
expertise, their participation could increase the effectiveness of the oversight function.
Conflicts of interest within the oversight function may arise due to the conflicting
interests of these members or due to relationships between members of the oversight
function and their clients or other stakeholders. To mitigate such conflicts, independent
members may be included within the oversight function – and they should be included
in those overseeing critical benchmarks due to their importance for market integrity,
financial stability, consumers, the real economy and the financing of households and
businesses in Member States. Where independent members are not available, it may be
appropriate for the administrator to adopt other procedures for managing conflicts of
interest such as excluding members from certain discussions or removing voting rights
of specific members.

(3)

In order to mitigate conflicts of interest, administrators may also allow staff of the
administrator to be members of the oversight function if they are not directly involved
in the provision of the relevant benchmarks. Such individuals could have appropriate
objectivity to oversee the benchmark without compromising its integrity.

(4)

An oversight function may include multiple functions, allowing for a tailored approach
to the oversight of different benchmarks, different types of benchmarks or different
families of benchmarks by committees with specific, dedicated competencies. An
oversight function may also include multiple functions carrying out different tasks, as
there may be operational reasons why persons with appropriate expertise cannot all sit
on committee – for example, geographical challenges. Both types of oversight functions
have a single person or committee in charge of the direction of the oversight function
and responsible for interaction with the management body of the administrator and with
the competent authority to facilitate the centralisation of oversight.

(5)

For certain benchmarks, it may be possible for a natural person to act as the oversight
function, provided the amount of time devoted to the oversight of the relevant
benchmarks is appropriate to their degree of use and complexity and to the risks they
pose. Such natural persons may be staff of the administrator or other external natural
persons contracted by the administrator to carry out the role of the oversight function.
External persons may be most appropriate when no staff of the administrator are
available to perform the function, however these persons must not have a vested interest
in the level of the benchmark. Where the oversight function is a natural person, it is
exempt from certain procedures which are only appropriate for a committee. Due to the
high degree of use of critical benchmarks and the risks they pose in certain instances,
critical benchmarks cannot be overseen by a natural person.

(6)

To fulfil the responsibilities of the oversight function, members may need to have expert
knowledge of the benchmark provision process but also of the underlying market the
benchmark seeks to measure. Such expertise may be sourced from users and
contributors active in the markets or from providers of regulated data. An oversight
function may benefit from the expertise of contributors and users have an interest in
ensuring the benchmark is robust. It is therefore appropriate that they be considered as
members for such benchmarks.

(7)

Staff of the administrator that are directly involved in the provision of the benchmark
may sit on the oversight function on condition they participate in a non-voting capacity
as they can provide necessary insight into the work of the administrator. Their status as
non-voting members is appropriate to ensure that the administrator does not hold undue
influence over the decisions of the oversight function at the expense of supervised
entities that use the benchmark, as well as other stakeholders.

(8)

The oversight function is an essential tool for managing conflicts of interest at the level
of the administrator and in order to ensure the integrity of the function, persons
convicted of financial services-related offences are prohibited from becoming members
of an oversight function.

(9)

Observers may also join the oversight function, for example if they have an interest in
the benchmark if it is widely used in their markets or if they can provide additional
expertise. Such individuals are considered observers rather than members, as their
presence is not permanent and they do not have voting rights. Their participation is
18

governed by the procedures of the oversight function as the final decision on whether or
not an observer should be permitted to join lies with the oversight function in order to
maintain the integrity of the oversight function.
(10)

Independent committees cannot be completely separated from the organisation of the
administrator as the final decisions with regards to the business of the administrator lie
with the management body and a separate committee could take decisions without fully
appreciating the potentially detrimental impact of such decisions on the business of the
administrator. An oversight function embedded within the organisation of the
administrator would be best placed to challenge the decisions of the administrator with
respect to the benchmarks.

(11)

In order for the oversight function to perform the role assigned by Regulation (EU) No
2016/1011, it is important that it has the ability to fully assess and challenge the
decisions of the management body of the administrator and that, in case of a
disagreement, the deliberations of the oversight function in this regard are recorded

(12)

In case the oversight function is a committee, procedures covering dispute resolution,
conflicts of interest management and criteria to select members and observers, amongst
others, are necessary to ensure that the oversight function, once established, can operate
without impediment. There may however be other procedures appropriate to specific
types of benchmarks or administrators which may not be envisaged in this Regulation
but are necessary for the correct governance of their benchmarks and oversight functions
are therefore free to introduce such additional procedures.

(13)

This Regulation is based on the draft regulatory technical standards submitted by the
European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) to the Commission.

(14)

ESMA has conducted open public consultations on the draft regulatory technical
standards on which this Regulation is based, analysed the potential related costs and
benefits and requested the opinion of the Securities and Markets Stakeholder Group
established in accordance with Article 37 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/20109.

HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
Composition of the oversight function
1. The structure and composition of the oversight function shall be appropriate to the
ownership and control structure of the administrator and shall be determined by the
administrator based on the nature, scale and complexity of the provision of the
benchmark and, where appropriate, in accordance with one or more of the nonexhaustive list of governance arrangements in Annex 1.
2. Where the benchmark is a critical benchmark, the oversight function shall be carried out
by a committee with at least two independent members. Independent members shall be
9

Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 November 2010 establishing a
European Supervisory Authority (European Securities and Markets Authority), amending Decision No 716/2009/EC and repealing
Commission Decision 2009/77/EC (OJ L 331, 15.12.2010, p. 84).

19

natural persons sitting on the oversight function who are not directly affiliated with the
administrator other than through their involvement in the oversight function, and do not
have a vested interest in the level of the relevant benchmark.
3. An administrator shall not establish an oversight function in accordance with Number 3
of the Annex for critical benchmarks or for regulated-data benchmarks that are used
directly or indirectly within a combination of benchmarks as a reference for financial
instruments or financial contracts or for measuring the performance of investment
funds, having a total value greater than the value given in Article 17(2) of Regulation
(EU) 1011/2016, on the basis of all the range of maturities or tenors of the benchmark.
4. The oversight function shall be composed of members that together have the skills,
knowledge and expertise appropriate to the oversight of the provision of a particular
benchmark, the underlying market or economic reality the benchmark seeks to measure
and to the responsibilities the oversight function is required to fulfil.
5. Where a benchmark is a regulated-data benchmark, the administrator shall consider
including, as members of the oversight function, representatives from the entities listed
in point (a) of Article 3(1)(24) of Regulation (EU) No 1011/2016 and, where applicable,
from entities contributing net asset values of investment funds.
6. Where a benchmark is based on contributions, and representatives of contributors or of
supervised entities that use the benchmark, and other relevant stakeholders, are
members of the oversight function, the administrator shall ensure that members with
conflicts of interest shall not hold a majority. The administrator shall also give due
consideration to conflicts arising from relationships between potential members and
other external stakeholders with a vested interest in the level of the relevant benchmarks.
7. Where staff of the administrator who are directly involved in the provision of the
benchmarks are members of the oversight function, the administrator shall ensure that
the members in question do not adversely affect the integrity of the oversight function.
Representatives of the management body may be invited to attend meetings by the
oversight function but shall not be permanent members of the oversight function.
8. Members shall not include persons who have been convicted of financial services
related offences, in particular manipulation or attempted manipulation under Regulation
(EU) No 596/2014.
9. Observers shall be permitted to join the oversight function, in accordance with the
procedures set out in Article 3(1)(b).
Article 2
Positioning of the oversight function
1. The positioning of the oversight function within the organisational structure of the
administrator shall be appropriate to provide effective scrutiny of the provision of the
benchmark(s).
2. The oversight function shall be embedded within the organisational structure of the
administrator but separate from the management body and other governance functions
of the benchmark administrator.
20

3. The oversight function shall assess and challenge the decisions of the management body
of the administrator with regards to benchmarks provision in order to fulfil the
requirements of Regulation (EU) No 2016/1011. The oversight function shall act
independently of the administrator where required by Article 5(3)(i) of Regulation (EU)
1011/2016 shall report all other recommendations on benchmarks oversight to the
management body.
4. Where the oversight function becomes aware that the management body acted or intends
to act contrary to recommendations resulting from a decision of the oversight function,
it shall record this clearly in the minutes of any meeting, or in records of decisions for
oversight functions established in accordance with Number 3 of the Annex.

Article 3
Procedures governing the oversight function
1. An oversight function shall have procedures relating to the following areas:
(a)

terms of reference for the oversight function, including the frequency of
meetings, which shall occur regularly, and the recording and publication of
minutes of the meetings or decisions of the oversight function;

(b)

criteria to select members of the oversight function, including evaluation of
members’ expertise and skills and the time commitments required, and to
identify appropriate observers that may be permitted to join some meetings of
the oversight function;

(l)

Arrangements to prevent improper disclosure of confidential or sensitive
information received, produced or discussed by the oversight function.

2. Where the oversight function is carried out by a natural person, subparagraph (e) of
paragraph 1 do not apply.

Article 4
Conflicts of interest management procedures
1. Conflicts of interest which may arise within the oversight function due to competing
interests of members shall be managed using, where appropriate, the following nonexhaustive list of procedures:
(a)

Require members to disclose conflicts ahead of the discussion of each agenda
item during meetings of the oversight function;

(b)

Prohibit staff directly involved in the provision of the benchmark from voting
on decisions of the oversight function;

(c)

Remove voting rights from members for decisions that would have a direct
business impact on the organisations they represent;

(d)

conflicted, record the exclusion in the minutes of any relevant meeting and
redact such minutes if they are published in accordance with Article 3(1)(a);

(e)

Restrict membership of the oversight function to persons not already sitting on
the oversight function of another administrator.

2. Where it is not possible to manage the conflicts of interest through the procedures in
paragraph 1 or by other means, the administrator shall revise the structure of the
oversight function and where appropriate, replace the conflicted members.
3. Where the oversight function is carried out by a natural person, subparagraphs (b) to (d)
of paragraph 1 do not apply. The natural person carrying out the oversight function shall
not be directly involved in the provision of the benchmark. Where the natural person
carrying out the oversight function represents another organisation, it shall not make
decisions that would have a direct business impact on such organisation.

Article 5
Entry into force
This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in
the Official Journal of the European Union.

3 Input data (Article 11 BMR)
3.1 Mandate
Article 11
5. ESMA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify further how to ensure
that input data is appropriate and verifiable, as required under points (a) and (b) of paragraph
1, as well as the internal oversight and verification procedures of a contributor that the
administrator has to ensure are in place, in compliance with point (b) of paragraph 3, in order
to ensure the integrity and accuracy of input data. However, the ESMA draft regulatory
technical standards shall not cover or apply to administrators of non-significant benchmarks.
ESMA shall take into account the different types of benchmarks and sectors as set out in this
Regulation, the nature of input data, the characteristics of the underlying market or economic
reality and the principle of proportionality, the vulnerability of the benchmarks to manipulation
as well as the international convergence of supervisory practice in relation to benchmarks.
ESMA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 1 April
2017.
Power is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to
in the first subparagraph in accordance with the procedure laid down in Articles 10 to 14 of
Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.

3.2 Background
Article 11 BMR
30. According to Article 11 paragraph 1 (a) of the Regulation (EU) 2016/1011, input data shall
be transaction data if available and appropriate. Point (b) of the same article adds that input
data must be verifiable.
31. Point (b) of Article 11, paragraph 3 of the Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 establishes that
where input data of a benchmark is contributed from a front office function in the contributor
organisation the administrator shall ensure that contributors have in place adequate
internal oversight and verification procedures. In the same paragraph of the provision, a
front-office is defined as any department, division, group or personnel of contributors or
any of its affiliates that performs any pricing, trading, sales, marketing, advertising,
solicitation, structuring, or brokerage activities
32. Article 11 paragraph 5 of the Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 requires ESMA to develop draft
RTS to specify further how to ensure that input data is appropriate and verifiable, as
required under points (a) and (b) of Article 11, paragraph 1.

25

33. ESMA is also required to draft RTS to specify further the internal oversight and verification
procedures of a contributor that an administrator has to ensure are in place, in compliance
with point (b) of Article 11, paragraph 3, of the Regulation (EU) 2016/1011, in order to
ensure the integrity and accuracy of input data.
34. In drafting those RTS, ESMA shall take into account the different types of benchmarks and
sectors as set out in the BMR, the nature of input data, the characteristics of the underlying
market or economic reality and the principle of proportionality, the vulnerability of the
benchmarks to manipulation as well as the international convergence of supervisory
practice in relation to benchmarks.
35. These draft RTS are applicable to critical and significant benchmarks but, in accordance
with Article 25, paragraph 1 of the Regulation (EU) 2016/1011, administrators of the latter
may waive the application of Article 11(3), and hence, of the related articles in these RTS
on front office contributions.
36. These draft RTS shall not cover or apply in the provision of non-significant benchmarks.
Content of the Discussion Paper
37. In the Discussion Paper, ESMA consulted on some general views it developed on
appropriateness and verifiability of input data and on front office contributions.
38. ESMA stated that a precondition for the verifiability requirement that rests on the
administrator is that clear and complete records are kept by the administrator. It also
established a minimum list of records to be kept and suggested weekly transmission of
information by contributors. Furthermore, it was proposed to apply verifiability criteria
differently depending on the extent to which input data relies on expert judgement or the
use of discretion. To this extent, it was suggested to exempt regulated data benchmarks
from input data record keeping.
39. Moreover, it was argued that appropriateness of input data cannot be verified except by
comparison with the criteria put forward in the methodology. Checks that may help the
administrator to assess the appropriateness of input data were accordingly enumerated.
40. In addition, ESMA suggested to scrutinise input data in three stages: evaluation, validation
and verification. Evaluation should consist of formal checks on each individual input data
submission received from a single contributor such as the input data contributed by an
authorised person, and provided on time and in the specified format. These checks were
to be carried out prior to the publication of the benchmark. While the validation stage should
consist of a posteriori substantive controls on the input data received from all contributors
such as the identification of outliers and anomalies or the comparison of input data against
previous contributions. Verification consisted of an in-depth examination of questionable
input data including the process of its creation. To this end, the administrator would rely on
information available in the market such as the comparison against historic series of data
from underlying or related markets / economic realities. In this case, the benchmark can
26

be compared to related markets’ rates from different maturities or currencies. Another
proposed way to verify questionable data is for administrator to back test input data, in the
case where they are non-transaction data, with transaction data as soon as those are
available.
41. The Discussion Paper also listed different safeguards that the administrator should ensure
are in place within the contributor where front office members contribute input data. The
safeguards envisaged included skills and training of staff working in functions related to
benchmark contribution, the establishment of a conflicts of interest policy covering a
minimum list of topics and contingency and emergency procedures, and internal oversight
at contributor level that ideally is based on the three lines of defence model. The three lines
of defence model was defined in relation to clear defined roles in the effective internal
oversight at the contributor level. The first line of defence referred to risk mitigation and
control by front office staff in order for them to be aware of the standards they are expected
to adhere to. The second line of defence referred to the activities of control functions such
as compliance, legal and risk that are independent from the front office. The third line of
defence referred to the activity of the internal audit.
42. Finally, differentiated applications were listed based on three distinct criteria: the type of
input data used, the size and the characteristics of the contributors.

3.3 Feedback from stakeholders
Appropriateness and verifiability of input data
43. The majority of the respondents agreed with the fact that the concept of appropriateness
is linked to the benchmark methodology but were of the opinion that verifying the
appropriateness of input data on a daily basis would be disproportionate. Furthermore,
some of them expressed the view that the checks to be performed by the administrator to
assess the appropriateness of input data were highly dependent on the type of input data
and on the methodology of the benchmark. In this context, some respondents disagreed
with the proposal in the Discussion Paper related to the fact that the administrator should
know the underlying sources and assumptions on which the contributor bases its
submission in the case of non-transaction data arguing that it consists of proprietary and
sensitive information that would reduce the willingness of some contributors to contribute
data if they were to share this information with the administrator. These respondents
suggested in this case that the administrator check the compliance with the general
submission framework instead of each individual submission. Furthermore, some
respondents expressed their concerns regarding the record keeping of the analyses
performed and stated that these requirements should not go beyond what is foreseen in
Article 8 of the Regulation 2016/1011.
44. Regarding the proposed record keeping obligation resting on administrators in order to
ensure the verifiability of input data, the majority of the respondents were of the opinion
that the list of records to be kept by the administrator was overly prescriptive and did not
necessarily reflect the diversity of benchmarks in the market and the specific risk profile of
27

the category of input data. While recognising the importance of verifiability of contributions,
they cautioned that requirements that indirectly require contributors to provide an
inappropriate amount of information may reduce the willingness of contributors to
contribute and so reduce the quality of the benchmark. Some respondents were of the
opinion that the administrator is best placed to determine what information is needed from
contributors in order to ensure verifiability. In addition, all respondents considered it
appropriate that the frequency of transmission of information by contributors would be
defined by the administrator. Finally, the majority of the respondents agreed that when
expert judgment is relied on, additional appropriate measures to ensure verifiability of input
data should be imposed.
45. The majority of the respondents agreed with the concepts of evaluation, validation and
verification of input data as developed in the Discussion Paper. At the same time, several
respondents argued that regulated data benchmarks, in view of the intrinsically more
verifiable character of the input data used, should not be obliged to guarantee verifiability
in the same manner as benchmarks using other types of input data. Furthermore, some
respondents suggested also to include additional checks to the list provided for in the
Discussion Paper in relation to the validation stage, such as a comparison of contributed
data against previous contributions and the observation of indicators related to contributed
data in order to verify market developments and possible influence on contributions.
Front office contributions
46. As suggested in the Discussion Paper, almost all respondents are of the opinion that all
staff involved in input data submission should undergo training. In addition, some
respondents opined that all staff, including submitters, management and staff in the
relevant control and audit functions should undergo appropriate training programs tailored
for their respective groups.
47. All respondents agreed with the three lines of defence principle as an ideal type of oversight
architecture but the majority called for a proportional approach of this principle. More
particularly, it was stated that the “four eyes” principle might not be practicable or
proportionate for all categories of benchmarks. In addition, it was suggested to accept other
oversight arrangements that achieve the same goals, depending on the scale and nature
of contributor’s organisation.
48. In order to improve oversight at the level of the contributor, one respondent suggested to
put in place an on-going cooperation between functions involved in the three lines of
defence in order to ensure a continuous flow of information between them.
49. The majority of respondents agreed with the list of elements that should be contained in
the conflicts of interest policy to be established in the case of front office contributions.
Some respondents, while agreeing with this list, called for proportionality by stating that the
conflicts of interest policy requirements should be generic enough so that smaller entities
have the flexibility to adapt the policy to their own structure and ensure, as much as
possible, the avoidance and management of conflicts of interest. Furthermore, some
28

respondents disagreed with the requirement for contributors to publicly disclose the
conflicts of interest policy as suggested in the Discussion Paper. In this context, they
suggest that making the policy available to the administrator should suffice.
50. Finally, the majority of the respondents agreed with the criteria that may justify
differentiation.

3.4 Proposed draft regulatory technical standards
Appropriateness and verifiability of input data
51. The obligation specified in points (a) and (b) of Article 11, paragraph 1, and paragraph 5 of
the Regulation (EU) 2016/1011, to ensure that input data is appropriate and verifiable, rests
on the administrator of the benchmark.
52. In these draft RTS, ESMA differentiates the two concepts of appropriateness and
verifiability as explained in the following paragraphs.
53. In ESMA’s view, appropriateness of input data refers to the capability of input data, in
conjunction with a benchmark’s methodology, to provide an accurate and reliable
representation of the market or economic reality the benchmark intends to measure, in
accordance with Article 11(4) of the Regulation (EU) 2016/1011.
54. Therefore, an administrator’s primary responsibility with respect to input data is to ensure
that it is appropriate with respect to the established methodology.
55. The close link established by ESMA between the appropriateness of input data and the
methodology of the benchmark have been acknowledged by the respondents to the
Discussion Paper.
56. These draft RTS state that the administrator shall specify the requirements to ensure
appropriateness of input data and establishes a minimum list of four elements these
requirements shall cover, such as the hierarchy of input data type or the relevant thresholds
for quality and quantity of input data. However, the appropriateness of input data depends
on the type of input data and on the methodology to be applied to the benchmark.
Therefore, and as expressed by some of the respondents to the Discussion Paper, this list
of elements must be covered by the requirements established by the administrator as
applicable to the relevant type of input data and benchmark. For example, if transaction
data from a related market is used, this should be compatible with the methodology with a
high degree of comparability of both markets. In the case of non-transaction data, the
administrator would ensure that this type of input data is compatible with the methodology
and that it accurately reflects the underlying market or economic reality.
57. The fact that input data is appropriate in the view of the methodology does not guarantee
that it will not be either vulnerable for manipulation or manipulated. For this reason,
Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 imposes that input data must, in addition, be verifiable.
29

58. Verifiability is the characteristic allowing the material plausibility of input data to be
checked. As suggested in the Discussion Paper and agreed by the majority of the
respondents to the Discussion Paper, verifiability is highly dependent on the type of input
data. More precisely, non-transaction data are less easily verifiable than regulated data
and transaction data.
59. Contrary to what was stated in the Discussion Paper and in light of the feed-back received,
the draft RTS do not impose additional record keeping obligations for the administrator to
ensure verifiability beyond what is required by the Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 to ensure
verifiability. Consequently, the draft RTS do not establish a minimum list of records to be
kept by the administrator. The main reason for this change of approach is that Article 8 of
the Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 already requires the administrator to keep records of some
information on which he may rely on so as to “enable an audit or evaluation of input data”
(see article 8(2)). Moreover, in accordance with Article 15, paragraph 2 of the Regulation
(EU) 2016/1011, contributors of critical benchmarks, significant and non-significant
benchmarks whose administrator do not waive the application of this Article of the
Regulation (EU) 2016/1011, are obliged to put in place record keeping policies as required
by the code of conduct of their administrator.
60. Nevertheless, ESMA is of the opinion that the obligation for the administrator to ensure
verifiability of input data is closely linked to the availability of sufficient information
supporting input data. Therefore, these draft RTS state that in order to ensure verifiability
of input data, the administrator must primarily rely on records kept on the basis of Article 8
of the Regulation (EU) 2016/1011. If existing records are not sufficient to ensure verifiability
of input data, the administrator may require additional information from contributors, by
specifying the content of the information needed and the frequency of transmission. From
a practical perspective, this additional information is a duplicate of the list of relevant
submission metadata that must be recorded by the contributor and that are included in the
draft RTS on code of conduct10. Although it might be argued this redundancy could be
avoided by referring to the list of records specified in the code of conduct RTS, this was
not the option retained by ESMA as the scope of these RTS and the RTS on code of
conduct may be different. On the one hand, the RTS on code of conduct, which should
detail the record keeping policies to be put in place at the level of the contributors, are
applicable to all benchmarks. Nevertheless, in accordance with Articles 25 and 26 of the
Regulation (EU) 2016/1011, significant and non-significant benchmarks may waive the
application of Article 15(2), and hence the application of the RTS on that subject. On the
other hand, the present RTS, to the extent it relates to appropriateness and verifiability,
apply to critical and significant benchmarks. As a consequence, even administrators of
significant benchmarks who choose to waive the application of Article 15, paragraph 2 of
the Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 and thus of the RTS on code of conduct, remain bound by
Article 11(1) and by this RTS. For this reason, each of the RTS needs to be self-standing
and the choice was made to repeat the list of records.

See section 5 – Code of conduct for Contributors.

61. Verifiability implies that administrators are able to carry out evaluation and validation which
consists in formal checks on input data submitted. These checks, which shall be more
extensive for non-transaction data, aim at allowing the administrator to assess the accuracy
and reliability of the input data received from the contributors based solely on the input data
contributed. Administrators of regulated data benchmarks are not subject to validation
requirements as in this case, verifiability must be more appropriately understood as
checking the provenance and transmission of the input data used.
62. These draft RTS also specify that the appropriateness of input data must be monitored by
the administrator on an ongoing basis through evaluation and validation. This is in order to
make clear that the appropriateness checks do not equate to a one shot screening of input
data received from a new contributor in the view of the methodology, but that the
requirements established to ensure appropriateness are themselves also subject to a
continuous monitoring. In contrast to what was stated in the Discussion Paper and as
requested by some respondents, ESMA does not specify further the frequency of this
check since this is dependent on the characteristics of the benchmark.
Q6: Do you agree with the appropriateness and verifiability of input data that the
administrator must ensure are in place? Please elaborate.
Front office contributions
63. In accordance with point b of Article 11, paragraph 3, of the Regulation (EU) 2016/1011,
the administrator must ensure that adequate internal oversight and verification procedures
are in place where contributions are made from a front-office function in a contributor
organisation. The reason for the establishment of such procedures is that contributions
coming from a front office function present a particular risk of manipulation as a result of
an inherent conflict of interest between the commercial role of the front office and its role
in the contribution to a benchmark.
64. Therefore, these draft RTS specify appropriate arrangements for oversight and verification
within the front office function of the contributor that the administrator shall ensure are in
place. These appropriate arrangements are the verification on the authorisation of
submitter and the building of a transparent internal oversight architecture structured along
three lines of defence.
65. In order to limit and manage the inherent risks and conflicts of interests related to the front
office function, administrators must ensure the effective functioning of the first line of
defence by way of tailored training programmes to raise awareness about the proper input
data submission procedures and that the second line of defence puts in place a conflict of
interest policy appropriate to the context of front office functions. The administrator shall
further verify that the contributors establish procedures (i) on whistleblowing (ii) to report
any suspicious behaviour and (iii) to make staff involved in input data contributions aware
of possible disciplinary sanctions.

31

66. As the RTS on code of conduct further specify the elements of the code of conduct referred
in article 15(2) of the Regulation (EU) 2016/1011, the question arose whether these RTS
could refer to the RTS on the code of conduct. Indeed, in accordance with Article 15,
paragraph 6 of the Regulation (EU) 2016/1011, the RTS on the contents of the code of
conduct states that the code of conduct of the administrator must provide specific rules on
the identification of submitters and that it shall establish policies, procedures and controls
that a contributor shall have in place, including amongst others, a conflict of interest policy,
a training programme for all staff involved in the contribution process and a whistleblowing
procedure. Therefore, for some of the abovementioned appropriate arrangements, these
RTS on front office contributions could have referred to the RTS on the Code of conduct.
67. Nevertheless, it was decided to enumerate all those appropriate arrangements in these
RTS rather than referring to the RTS on the code of conduct for some of these because
the scope of these RTS and the RTS on the code of conduct differs in two points:
a. the RTS on code of conduct are applicable to all contributors while these RTS only
apply where input data of a benchmark is contributed from the front office function
of a contributor;
b. the RTS on code of conduct apply to all benchmarks but in accordance with Article
25 and 26 of the Regulation (EU) 2016/1011, significant and non-significant
benchmarks may waive the application of Article 15(2) BMR, and hence the
application of the RTS on that subject. While these RTS on front office contributions
only applies to critical and significant benchmarks but, in accordance with Article
25, paragraph 1 of the Regulation (EU) 2016/1011, the latter may waive the
application of Article 11(3) and, by consequence, of the related articles of these
RTS on front office contributions.
68. In the light of the abovementioned reasons, a cross-reference between these RTS and the
RTS on the Code of Conduct risks creating undesirable consequences and
inconsistencies.
69. The Discussion Paper proposal in relation to training was that staff involved in input data
contribution and front office staff should undergo compulsory and appropriate training with
the latter having more frequent and specific training. However, some of the respondents
did not support this proposal and in order to be in line with point b of Article 11, paragraph
3 of the Regulation (EU) 2016/1011, the training programmes detailed in these draft RTS
only apply to front office staff. While the general training requirements for staff involved in
the contribution process are specified in the RTS on the code of conduct.
70. As agreed by the majority of the respondents, the internal oversight within contributors
where input data of a benchmark is contributed from a front office function shall be
structured along three lines of defence as described in paragraph 12. ESMA is of the view
to include a process ensuring on-going cooperation between the lines of defence as also
suggested by one respondent in order to increase the efficiency of the internal oversight
within the contributor organisation.
32

71. This internal oversight at the level of the contributor should also be transparent to the
administrator. This transparency includes the communication of the organisational
arrangements and roles and responsibilities for input data contribution and the identity of
submitters.
72. At the same time, respondents called for a proportional approach of this oversight
architecture. Hence, the draft RTS state that administrators of significant benchmarks shall
not require that contributors implement a “four eyes” principle if they demonstrate that
adequate alternative safeguards are in place, and that administrators of significant
benchmarks may allow a simplified internal oversight architecture taking into account the
size of the contributor. In addition, for supervised contributors, administrators of significant
benchmarks may allow the reliance on pre-existing internal oversight procedures.
73. The Discussion Paper proposed a conflict of interest policy in order to mitigate the risk of
conflict of interests that arises when input data is contributed from the front office function
and the staff has discretion regarding contributed data while at the same time have for
example exposure against the relevant benchmark. This policy includes different measures
such as disclosure and reporting of conflicts of interest, remuneration policies, and the
physical separation between front office staff involved in contributing input data and other
front office staff in order to limit improper or inadvertent communication of sensitive
information between staff. The Discussion Paper also suggested to disclose this policy to
the public. However, in the light of the comments received, and in order to limit adverse
effects of the public disclosure, ESMA supports that the conflict of interest policy be made
available to the administrator upon request.
74. Furthermore, in line with the proportionality principle and as requested by the majority of
the respondents, administrators of significant benchmarks may exempt contributors from
(i) establishing a clear segregation of duties between front office staff involved in input data
contribution and other front office staff and (ii) from putting in place a physical separation
between these persons, on the condition that the contributor demonstrates the existence
of sound principles and procedures to manage conflicts of interests. This is due to the fact
that some contributors of significant benchmarks may find it difficult to implement in
practice these requirements in relation to the size of these contributors.
75. Finally, in the view of the particular risks arising from the simultaneous commercial and
contribution roles of a front office function, these draft RTS state that a contributor whose
front office contribute to the benchmark must put in place a whistleblowing procedure in
order to escalate any misconduct in the contribution process, must inform front office staff
of the possible disciplinary sanctions in case of breach of the policies and procedures
related to benchmarks. In addition, the contributor should establish contingency measures
or fall-back arrangements to ensure the provision of input data during conditions of market
stress and a reporting system allowing front office contributors to notify the administrator
any attempted or actual manipulation or failure to comply with benchmark related
procedures and policies.

Q7: Do you agree with the internal oversight and verification procedures that the
administrator must ensure are in place where contributions are made from a frontoffice function in a contributor organisation? Please elaborate.

3.5 Draft technical standards: Input data

COMMISSION DELEGATED REGULATION (EU) No …/..
of XXX
[…]

supplementing Regulation (EU) No 2016/1011 of the European Parliament
and of the Council with regard to regulatory technical standards for
appropriateness and verifiability of input data and for internal oversight
and verification procedures of a contributor the administrator has to
ensure are in place where input data is contributed from a front office
function

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EU) No 2016/1011 of the European Parliament and of the Council
of 8 June 2016 on indices used as benchmarks in financial instruments and financial contracts
or to measure the performance of investment funds and amending Directives 2008/48/EC and
2014/17/EU and Regulation (EU) No 596/201411, and in particular Article 11(5) thereof,
Whereas:
(1)

Appropriateness relates to the compatibility of input data with the methodology, the
conjunction of which must allow a benchmark to reflect the underlying market or
economic reality.

(2)

The specification of conditions input data must meet in order to be appropriate, in
conjunction with methodology, should be undertaken by the administrator in view of
the degree of representativeness of the input data that it could gather with respect to the
market or economic reality that the benchmark is intended to measure, in compliance
with what is required under Article 11, paragraph 4 of Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 and
mindful of the actions required there.

(3)

Verifiability, as an obligation for the administrator, depends on the availability of
sufficient information underpinning the input data. Information that is needed from
contributors in order to ensure verifiability of input data is to be specified by the

11

OJ L 171, 29.6.2016, p. 1.

35

administrator. The administrator disposes of several means to communicate requests
and expectations to contributors, including, but not limited to, the code of conduct.
(4)

Verifiability is highly dependent on the type of input data used. For example, regulated
data by themselves present a high degree of verifiability as a result of the application of
sectoral disciplines. By contrast, types of input data that are less easily verifiable,
notably non-transaction data, may still meet the requirement of verifiability if sufficient
submission metadata is available to conduct extensive validation checks.

(5)

Evaluation and validation of input data are ongoing obligations for administrators,
which are conditional on the verifiability of input data.

(6)

Contributions coming from a front office function present a particular risk as a result of
an inherent conflict of interest between the commercial role of the front office and its
role in contribution to a benchmark. The obligation of ensuring that adequate internal
oversight and verification procedures are in place within a contributor organisation
where contributions are made from a front office function rests on the administrator.
Effective internal oversight in this specific instance relies on appropriate structures
within the contributor organisation such as the three lines of defence model.

(7)

As an element of the first line of defence, it is important that contributor staff involved
in input data submission are made aware, through tailored training programmes, of the
proper procedures for input data submission.

(8)

Moreover, the oversight function within the contributor organisation should implement
and maintain a conflicts of interest policy.

(9)

A further element that may clarify the behavioural expectations of staff involved in input
data contribution is the awareness of possible disciplinary sanctions for breach of
established procedures.

(10)

A notable tool that may be useful in bringing to light and escalating any misconduct
would be the establishment of a whistleblowing procedure that permits any staff
member to report an instance of misconduct to the relevant internal oversight function.

(11)

If misconduct is detected by the contributor, it is important that the administrator is
notified immediately through the reporting of suspicious behaviour.

(12)

For significant benchmarks, it may be appropriate to afford administrators additional
discretion in how they ensure internal oversight and verification at contributor level. In
particular, it may be justified to differentiate the required measures in accordance with
the size of the contributor organisation or according to pre-existing regulatory
obligations to which contributors are subject.

(13)

This Regulation is based on the draft regulatory technical standards submitted by the
European Securities and Markets Authority to the Commission.

(14)

The European Securities and Markets Authority has conducted open public
consultations on the draft regulatory technical standards on which this Regulation is
based, analysed the potential related costs and benefits and requested the opinion of the

36

Securities Markets Stakeholder Group established in accordance with Article 37 of
Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council12.
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:

Chapter I – Appropriateness and verifiability of input data
Article 1
Appropriateness of input data
1. Administrators shall specify requirements to ensure that the input data obtained is
appropriate in view of the methodology and that it accurately and reliably represents the
market or economic reality that the benchmark is intended to measure. The requirements
shall cover at least, as applicable to the relevant type of input data and benchmark:
(a) relevant thresholds for quantity and quality of input data;
(b) hierarchy of input data types;
(c) justification required for use of other than the primary types of input data;
(d) justification required for the exercise of any discretion or expert judgement in the
contribution of input data.
2. Appropriateness shall be monitored on an ongoing basis through evaluation and validation.

Article 2
Verifiability of input data
1. Input data is verifiable when it can be checked to be accurate or to stem from a reliable
source.
2. In order to demonstrate the verifiability of input data, an administrator shall ensure the
availability of all submission metadata required to carry out the checks referred to in Article
3.
3. For the purpose of paragraph 2, an administrator relies on information recorded in
accordance with Article 8 of the Regulation (EU) 2016/1011.
4. If additional information is necessary to demonstrate the verifiability of input data, an
administrator shall be able to require it from contributors, and shall specify its precise
content and the frequency with which it should be transmitted.

12

Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 November 2010 establishing a European
Supervisory Authority (European Securities and Markets Authority), amending Decision No 716/2009/EC and repealing
Commission Decision 2009/77/EC (OJ L 331, 15.12.2010, p. 84).

37

Article 3
Evaluation and validation
Verifiability of input data implies that administrators are able to carry out the following checks
on these data:
1. Evaluation, consisting of at least the following formal checks on each individual input data
contribution:
(a) whether the input data is contributed by an authorised submitter;
(b) whether input data is provided on time;
(c) whether input data is provided in the format specified
(d) whether input data fulfils the quantitative threshold set in the methodology, if any.
2. Validation, conducted after publication of the benchmark, making use of techniques such
as, where applicable:
(a) comparison within contributions from different contributors;
(b) comparison against previous contributions;
(c) comparison against related market indicators;
(d) comparison against historic series of data from underlying or related markets/economic
realities;
(e) for non-transaction data: back testing to corroborate input data when transaction data
become available;
(f) checking coherence of the contribution with relevant contribution metadata recorded by
the contributor, which may include:
i) policies and procedures governing the contributions and relevant changes therein;
ii) substantial exposures of individual traders or trading desks to benchmark-related
instruments as well as changes therein;
iii) a record of disciplinary actions taken against any contributor’s staff in respect of
benchmark-related activities;
iv) a list of submitters and approvers (if applicable), including their names and general
roles, with the dates when submission-related roles where authorised and exited;
v) and, with reference to each specific contribution to be validated:
(1) date and time of the contribution;
(2) data inputs considered, data excluded and any other exercise of discretion;
(3) communication between the contributors and the administrator;
(4) relevant communication between the submitter and approvers within the
contributor (if applicable);
38

(5) records of input data queries and their respective outcomes;
(6) recordings of telephone conversations;
(7) electronic communications;
(8) data traffic records;
(9) whistleblowing disclosures.

Article 4
Regulated data benchmarks
Administrators of regulated data benchmarks are not subject to Article 3, paragraph 2.
Chapter II – Internal oversight and verification procedures in case of front office
contributions
Article 5
Authorisation of front office submitters
Upon receiving the input data submission from the contributor, the administrator shall require
information allowing the verification that the submitter has been permitted to submit input data
on behalf of that contributor.

Article 6
Oversight and verification measures at contributor level
Where input data is contributed from a front office function, the administrator shall ensure that
the contributor has the following oversight and verification procedures in place:
1. Administrators shall ensure that contributor’s internal oversight is structured along three

lines of defence and operates in accordance with a written procedure describing the
respective roles of the first, second and third line of defence as well as the method of
cooperation and flow of information between these functions. Administrators shall ensure
that operations of internal oversight function are subject to regular reporting to senior
management and that all internal oversight and verification procedures are communicated
to them upon request.
2. Administrators shall ensure that the first line of defence comprises front office staff which
are aware of the procedure for input data contribution as well as of clear behavioural
expectations:
(a) Elaborating training programmes tailored to the specific responsibilities of front office
staff concerning at least:
39

i) the code of conduct;
ii) the applicable laws and regulations;
iii) the contributor’s internal control framework;
iv) the contributor’s internal conflicts of interest procedure;
v) ethical standards;
vi) the whistleblowing procedure;
vii) disciplinary actions.
Administrators shall ensure that front office staff undergo training periodically or as
necessary if there are material changes to the policies, procedures, or in response to specific
events.
(b) Performing effective checking processes of input data contributions such as a four-eyes
process. Administrators shall ensure that contributions are prepared by an authorised
submitter and reviewed for reasonableness, accuracy and completeness prior to
contribution.
(c) Excluding the access of contributions to persons not involved in the submission process,
except under the following circumstances, in which case the data will be restricted to
those who need to have access to it, such as, but not limited to:
i) audit;
ii) investigations for suspicious inputs or errors.
(d) Setting up contingency measures or fall-back arrangements to ensure the provision of
input data in the event of a disruption to the process of the provision of input data such
as market stress.
3. Administrators shall ensure that the second line of defence comprises at least risk and
compliance functions:
(a) performing a second level and independent control in relation to the reasonableness,
accuracy and completeness of the contributions;
(b) maintaining a whistleblowing procedure to assist internal oversight functions in
detecting activities affecting the integrity of the benchmark;
(c) maintaining procedures to notify the administrator immediately when they become
aware of any attempted or actual manipulation or failure to comply with benchmarkrelated policies and procedures;
(d) maintaining a physical presence in the front office where applicable;
(e) monitoring communications within the front office and between the front office and
other internal functions;
(f) monitoring communications between the front office and external bodies;
(g) performing regular checks for suspicious communication;
(h) establishing and maintaining a conflicts of interest policy that is appropriate to the
context of front office contributions, covering:
40

i) disclosure to the administrator of actual or potential conflicts of interest of the
contributor and of the contributor’s front office staff members who are involved in
the contribution;
ii) identification and reporting of conflicts of interest;
iii) avoiding the existence of any direct link between the remuneration of staff involved
in input data contribution and the remuneration of or revenue generated by other
contributor staff principally engaged in another activity, where a conflict of interest
may arise in relation to those activities;
iv) clear segregation of duties between front office staff involved in contributing input
data and other front office staff;
v) physical separation between front office staff involved in contributing input data
and other front office staff;
vi) effective procedures to prevent or control the exchange of information between front
office staff and other contributor’s staff, where the exchange of that information
may affect the input data contributed;
vii) measures to prevent any person from exercising inappropriate influence over the
way in which front office staff involved in contributing input data carry out
activities;
viii) contingency provisions in case of temporary inefficiency of the controls of the
flow of information
4. Administrators shall ensure that the third line of defence comprises at least the internal audit
function performing independent checks on a regular basis on the controls exercised by the
two lines of defence which may include, depending on the type of input data contributed,
techniques such as:
(a) comparison against previous contributions;
(b) comparison against related market indicators, where available;
(c) for non-transaction data: back testing to corroborate input data when transaction data
become available.
Article 7
Significant benchmarks
1. Administrators of significant benchmarks may elect not to require that contributors
implement a four-eyes process for contribution of input data, if they demonstrate that
adequate alternative safeguards are in place to ensure reasonableness, accuracy and
completeness of input data.
2. Administrators of significant benchmarks may elect to require the measures specified in
Article 6, para. 3, h) iv) and h) v) only where appropriate, taking into account the nature,
scale and complexity of the contributor’s activities and whether the contribution activity is
part of the core business of the contributor or constitutes an ancillary activity, on the

41

condition that the contributor demonstrates the existence of sound principles and procedures
to manage conflicts of interest.
3. For supervised contributors, administrators of significant benchmarks may allow that the
required internal oversight procedures in Article 6, be aligned to pre-existing internal
oversight structures.
4. Administrators of significant benchmarks may allow a simplified internal oversight
architecture for contributors the size of whose organisation does not allow the establishment
of three separate lines of defence.

4 Transparency of methodology (Article 13 BMR)
4.1 Mandate
Article 13
1. An administrator shall develop, operate and administer the benchmark and methodology
transparently. To that end, the administrator shall publish or make available the following
information:
(a) the key elements of the methodology that the administrator uses for each benchmark
provided and published or, when applicable, for each family of benchmarks provided and
published;
(b) details of the internal review and the approval of a given methodology, as well as the
frequency of such review;
(c) the procedures for consulting on any proposed material change in the administrator's
methodology and the rationale for such changes, including a definition of what constitutes a
material change and the circumstances in which the administrator is to notify users of any such
changes.
2. The procedures required under point (c) of paragraph 1 shall provide for:
(a) advance notice, with a clear time frame, that gives the opportunity to analyse and comment
upon the impact of such proposed material changes; and
(b) the comments referred to in point (a) of this paragraph, and the administrator's response to
those comments, to be made accessible after any consultation, except where confidentiality
has been requested by the originator of the comments.
3. ESMA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify further the information
to be provided by an administrator in compliance with the requirements laid down in
paragraphs 1 and 2, distinguishing for different types of benchmarks and sectors as set out in
this Regulation. ESMA shall take into account the need to disclose those elements of the
methodology that provide for sufficient detail to allow users to understand how a benchmark is
provided and to assess its representativeness, its relevance to particular users and its
appropriateness as a reference for financial instruments and contracts and the principle of
proportionality. However, the ESMA draft regulatory technical standards shall not cover or
apply to administrators of non-significant benchmarks.
ESMA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 1 April
2017.
Power is delegated to the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to
in the first subparagraph in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.

4.2 Background
76. According to Regulation (EU) 2016/1011, an administrator has control over the provision
of a benchmark which includes “determining a benchmark through the application of a
formula or other method of calculation”. The accuracy and reliability of a benchmark in
representing the economic reality it is intended to measure mainly depends on the

43

methodology used. It is therefore necessary to adopt a methodology that ensures the
reliability and accuracy of the benchmark and is accountable through transparency.
77. ESMA is required to further specify the key elements of the methodology to be disclosed
in order for users to understand how the benchmark is provided and to assess the
appropriateness of the benchmark to their intended use, as a reference for financial
instruments and financial contracts or to measure the performance of investment funds.
78. Once the methodology is established and internally approved by the benchmark’s
administrator, it may be subject to changes, in order to ensure the continued accuracy of
the benchmark. According to Article 13(1)(b) of Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 the definition
of the frequency of the review of the methodology lies with the administrator.
79. Any changes to the methodology have an impact on users and stakeholders of the
benchmark. It is therefore necessary for the administrator to follow procedures that ESMA
is required to further specify when changing the methodology of the benchmark. In
particular, when the changes are deemed material, a consultation is needed in order to
allow users and stakeholders to take the necessary actions in light of these changes or
notify the administrator if they have concerns about these changes.

4.3 Responses to the Discussion Paper
80. In its Discussion Paper, ESMA proposed a minimum list of key elements of the
methodology to be disclosed that was supported by a large majority of respondents.
However, while some respondents stated that this minimum list is sufficient and additional
elements of the benchmark’s methodology should not be disclosed, others further argued
that some transparency requirements foreseen in the UCITS framework 13 should be
included as key elements of the benchmark’s methodology. These last respondents
highlight that fund managers need to have access to a number of data related to
benchmarks, the collection of which can be difficult and highly dependent on the
administrators of benchmarks.
81. In relation to the internal review of the methodology, the respondents were generally in
favour of ESMA’s proposal in the Discussion Paper to leave some discretion to
administrators to set the frequency of the internal review of the methodology. However,
they did not support ESMA’s approach to disclose in addition to the procedure for internal
review and approval of the methodology, the names of the persons responsible for
reviewing the methodology, stressing that there might be adverse effects to publishing such
names.
82. Market participants were generally in favour of the proposal made in the Discussion Paper
in relation to the consultation procedure for material changes of the methodology. However,
several respondents pointed out that in certain circumstances, an administrator may need

13

ESMA Guidelines for competent authorities and UCITS management companies, 1 August 2014.

44

to implement material changes to the methodology rapidly and that a long and
cumbersome consultation process may be an impediment in this regard.
83. Furthermore, while respondents agreed with ESMA’s approach in relation to the publication
on the administrator’s or the benchmark’s website of the consultation procedure for
material changes in benchmark’s methodology, as well as material changes in
benchmark’s methodology themselves and the elaboration of comments received, they do
not support the proposal in relation to the availability of hard copies.
84. Some market participants proposed also to allow the administrator to differentiate the
procedure to be applied according to the material change envisaged. They also highlighted
that the publication of a summary of the responses to the consultation on material changes
should be sufficient.

4.4 Key elements of the methodology
85. In relation to Article 13, Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 states in Recital 27 that the
transparency of the methodology should not be meant as the publication of the formula
applied for the determination of a benchmark, but rather the disclosure of the elements
sufficient to allow stakeholders to understand how the benchmark is derived and to assess
its representativeness, relevance and appropriateness for its intended use.
86. On the way to compromise between opposite views, ESMA is including in its draft RTS a
description of the constituents of the benchmark’s index in order for market participants to
be informed about the universe of the benchmark’s constituents and to have a better
understanding of the methodology of the benchmark to allow them to assess the
consistency of the benchmark with their intended use.
87. Furthermore, as stated by some respondents, ESMA mentions in its draft RTS that the key
elements should be disclosed as applicable to the relevant benchmark and input data used.
For example, the disclosure of the panel composition and eligibility criteria for panel
membership would only apply to benchmarks based on contributions.
88. The administrator should disclose the following elements in order to allow users to
understand the objective of the index and the underlying market it intends to measure:
a. the definition of the benchmark and of the market or economic reality it intends to
measure;
b. an estimate of the size of the underlying market;
c. the unit of measurement of the benchmark.
89. If the administrator has discretion in the selection and composition of inputs, the
administrator should disclose the criteria applied to select input data. When relevant to the

45

methodology used, the priority given to different types of input data and the minimum
quantity or quality of input data required should also be published.
90. According to Article 12(1)(e) of Regulation (EU) 2016/1011, the methodology should be
traceable and verifiable. One of the key elements to be disclosed is therefore the means
to ensure that the methodology is traceable and verifiable which could include the use of a
secured algorithm for the calculation of the benchmark.
91. ESMA also found it useful to enlarge the list of key elements and to include in its draft RTS
other key elements of the methodology such as contingency measures during conditions
of market stress or when thresholds for minimum quantity and quality of input data are not
met and limitations of the methodology, including - but not limited to - in illiquid markets.
These elements would allow users to understand how the methodology of the benchmark
would react to adverse conditions of the market. This approach was also supported by
some of the comments received to the Discussion Paper.
92. In line with the principle of proportionality and in order to reduce the burden on
administrators of significant benchmarks, the draft RTS allow these administrators to opt
out from the disclosure of certain elements of the methodology.
Q8: Do you agree with the list of key elements proposed? Do you consider that there
are any other means that could be taken into consideration to ensure that the
benchmark’s methodology is traceable and verifiable?

4.5 Internal review and approval of the methodology
93. In order to ensure the continued accuracy of the benchmark and its representativeness of
the underlying market or economic reality, it may be necessary to change the methodology.
However, any change of the methodology has an impact on the end users and
stakeholders of the benchmark and should therefore be made available to the public.
94. In the Discussion Paper, ESMA proposed to disclose in addition to the procedure for
internal review and approval of the methodology, the names of the persons responsible for
reviewing the methodology in order to avoid possible conflicts of interest. However, ESMA
acknowledges market participants concerns in relation to the adverse effects to publishing
names of persons and is limiting in the draft RTS the publication to the bodies or functions
and to the role of the persons involved in the review and approval of the methodology and
to the general characteristics of the procedures for their nomination and removal. These
transparency requirements would in ESMA’s opinion be sufficient to address the possible
conflicts of interest that would arise during the process of the internal review of the
methodology.
95. As supported by the responses to the Discussion Paper, ESMA is of the view that it is
appropriate to leave some discretion to administrators to set the frequency of the internal
review of the methodology, which is dependent on the characteristics of the benchmark
and on the evolution of the related market or of the characteristics of the underlying market
46

or economic reality the benchmark intends to measure. This discretion is limited however
by the mandatory review of the methodology by the oversight function according to Article
5(3)(a) of the Regulation 2016/1011, which should be conducted at least annually.
Q9: Do you agree with the elements of the internal review of methodology to be
disclosed? Do you consider that there are other elements of information regarding
the procedure for internal review of methodology that should be included?

4.6 Procedure for material change of methodology
96. As stated above, material changes to the methodology affect end users of the benchmark
and more generally stakeholders who should therefore be duly informed in advance and
consulted in order for them to comment on these material changes and express any
difficulties that these changes would imply.
97. Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 requires administrators to publish the procedure for the
consultation on proposed material changes in their methodology along with the rationale
for such changes, including a definition of what constitutes a material change.
98. Although some respondents to the Discussion Paper suggested that an exemption from
the obligation to consult on material changes should be available to administrators to allow
for swift adaptation of a benchmark’s methodology in response to sudden market events,
or in case the administrator is required to change a benchmark’s methodology after a
decision by the competent authority in the circumstances envisaged in Art. 23(6)(d) of the
Regulation (EU) 2016/1011, ESMA is of the opinion that its empowerment does not allow
for the creation of such an exemption.
99. As regards the proposal in the Discussion Paper in relation to the availability of hard copies
upon request during the consultation procedure, ESMA’s opinion is to leave this up to the
discretion of the administrator, as long as all information is electronically available.
100. ESMA would also like to stress to market participants that according to the Regulation
(EU) 2016/1011, Article 13(3) these draft RTS do not apply to non-significant benchmarks.
101. In relation to the suggestion of some market participants to allow the administrator to
differentiate the procedure to be applied according to the material change envisaged,
ESMA highlights that this distinction is already embedded in the definition that the
administrator will specify to a material change and would be included in the distinction
between the procedure to be applied for material and non-material changes.
102. According to Regulation (EU) 2016/1011, the comments along with the responses to
those comments by the administrator should be made accessible after any consultation
except when confidentiality has been requested. Therefore, ESMA cannot support the
publication of a summary of comments in order to avoid any risk of selecting comments
and biasing the publication to users and stakeholders.

4.7 Draft technical standards: Transparency of methodology

COMMISSION DELEGATED REGULATION (EU) No …/..
of XXX
[…]

supplementing Regulation (EU) No 2016/1011 of the European Parliament
and of the Council with regard to regulatory technical standards for
information to be provided on key elements of methodology, internal review
of methodology and the procedure to consult on material changes of
methodology.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EU) No 2016/1011 of the European Parliament and of the Council
of 08 June 2016 on indices used as benchmarks in financial instruments and financial contracts
or to measure the performance of investment funds and amending Directives 2008/48/EC and
2014/17/EU and Regulation (EU) No 596/201414, and in particular Article 13(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1)

Disclosure of key elements of the methodology serves the purpose of allowing users and
potential users to understand how a benchmark is derived, what it measures and
therefore to understand the appropriateness of the benchmark for their purposes and any
limitations or risks of the methodology.

(2)

Benchmarks’ methodologies are highly divergent. Any minimum list of key elements
should therefore allow for its application only in so far as it is relevant to a particular
benchmark methodology. For example, information on minimum liquidity that is
specified for benchmark constituents may be relevant for equity benchmarks but not for
commodity benchmarks.

(3)

For the purposes of ensuring the benchmark’s reliability and accuracy, one of the key
elements to be disclosed by the administrator is the definition of a minimum quantity

14

OJ L 171, 29.6.2016, p. 1.

49

and/or quality of input data in order to be able to apply the methodology of the
benchmark and perform its calculation. In addition, when these standards of quantity or
quality of input data are not met the methodology should describe the methodology of
calculation in such exceptional circumstances.
(4)

The use of discretion in the determination of benchmarks increases their vulnerability
to manipulation. In order to minimise this risk of manipulation, clear rules in relation to
the circumstances when discretion can be used and how this discretion may be exercised
should be disclosed by the administrator as part of the key elements of the methodology.

(5)

As markets change over time, an administrator may consider that a benchmark does no
longer represent the market it intends to measure, and may decide to review its
methodology to remedy this deficiency. It is important that users and potential users are
sufficiently informed of this process, including its frequency, procedure, the bodies
involved and the relevant governance process in which it is embedded.

(6)

Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 requires information regarding key elements of
methodology and internal review of methodology be publicly accessible for critical and
significant benchmarks. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, this
Regulation avoids putting an excessive burden on administrators of significant
benchmarks, by allowing them to choose to reduce disclosure to a more limited set of
elements or to disclose certain elements at a reduced level of detail.

(7)

Whenever a benchmark administrator judges a change in methodology to be material in
nature, an adequate consultation procedure should be followed. This procedure should
communicate a level of information regarding the change that enables users and
potential users to assess the expected impact of a proposed material change and provide
them with a mechanism to give feedback on this change to the administrator.

(8)

In order to safeguard a user’s or potential user’s capacity of understanding how a
benchmark is derived, what it measures and therefore of understanding the
appropriateness of the benchmark for their purposes and any limitations or risks of the
methodology, the rationale behind each proposed material change shall be disclosed.

(9)

The transparency of the consultation procedure may be ensured by publishing the
comments received as well as the administrator’s response to those comments. For
critical benchmarks, both comments received and administrators’ responses thereto
should be accessible in full. For significant benchmarks, accessibility of the
admnistrator’s responses to comments may be achieved by way of publishing a feedback
statement. Respondents may, however, request confidentiality of their response, which
shall be respected by the administrator.

(10)

This Regulation is based on the draft regulatory technical standards submitted by the
European Securities and Markets Authority to the Commission.

(11)

The European Securities and Markets Authority has conducted open public
consultations on the draft regulatory technical standards on which this Regulation is
based, analysed the potential related costs and benefits and requested the opinion of the

50

5 Code of conduct for contributors (Article 15 BMR)
5.1 Mandate
Article 15
6. ESMA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to further specify the elements of
the code of conduct referred to in paragraph 2 for different types of benchmarks, and in order
to take account of developments in benchmarks and financial markets.
ESMA shall take into account the different characteristics of benchmarks and contributors,
notably in terms of differences in input data and methodologies, the risks of input data being
manipulated and international convergence of supervisory practices in relation to benchmarks.
ESMA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 1 April
2017.

5.2 General remarks
103. Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 (“the Regulation”) requires administrators, for each of the
benchmarks or families of benchmarks they provide, to produce a code of conduct to
specify the responsibilities for contributors with respect to aspects already indicated in
Article 15, paragraph 2, of the Regulation, among which input data, record keeping,
suspicious input data reporting and conflict management requirements. The integrity and
accuracy of a benchmark depends on the integrity and accuracy of the input data provided
by all contributors. Such obligations should be relied on and should be consistent with the
benchmark administrator’s methodology and the controls the administrator performs on the
input data received, as well as with the characteristics of the benchmark’s underlying
market or economic reality and of the relevant input data.
104. A code of conduct is only necessary where a benchmark is based on contributions from
contributors, as defined in Articles 3(8) and 15(1), of the Regulation. Input data that is
readily available to an administrator is not considered a contribution. Benchmarks based
on regulated data will not be subject to Article 15 due to the exemption under Article 17(1).
According to Article 19(1) administrators of commodity benchmarks, where the majority of
contributors are non-supervised entities, will not be required to maintain a code of conduct
for those benchmarks, as they are subject to Annex II.
105. The mandate for these Regulatory Technical Standards requires the further
specification of the details of Art 15(2) only. Subject to Article 25 and Article 26,
administrators of significant and non-significant benchmarks can take the decision not to
apply Article 15(2) which lays out the specific elements to be included in a code of conduct.
Where article 15(2) is not applied, as stated above, those administrators of significant or
non-significant benchmarks will be required to maintain a code of conduct for each
54

benchmark or family of benchmarks but are free to determine the details to be included in
the code.
106. Under Article 15(1) administrators are required to be continuously satisfied, or at least
annually, that the contributors adhere to the code. For third country contributors, the
administrator should do so to the extent possible (Recital 30). In case of indications of nonadherence of one or more contributors, the administrator should not use input data from
those contributors and in such a case should obtain representative publicly available data
(Article 11(1)(e) of the Regulation).
107. Administrators are required to ensure that their code(s) complies with the content of the
Regulation. Competent Authorities, in case they find elements of the code of conduct which
do not comply with the requirements of the BMR, can require the administrator to make
adjustments of the Code of Conduct for a benchmark. Additionally, in case the competent
authority considers that the representativeness of a critical benchmark is put at risk, after
the assessment conducted according to Article 23 of the Regulation, it may ask the
administrator to change the relative code of conduct.
108. The mandate under Article 15 of the Regulation requires ESMA to specify the terms of
the code of conduct for different types of benchmarks and to take into account
developments in benchmarks and financial markets. It is also necessary for ESMA to
consider the different characteristics of benchmarks and contributors.
109. Although it is the Administrator’s prerogative to decide how they will be satisfied that
contributors adhere to the code of conduct, it is expected that the contributors undertake
internal checks to ensure that they achieve compliance with the administrator’s code of
conduct.

5.3 Code of conduct
110. The scope of this RTS includes that the code of conduct provides for a clear description
of input data to be provided and the requirements necessary to ensure that input data is
provided in accordance with Article 11 on Input Data. The scope also mandates that the
code of conduct states the policies to ensure that a contributor provides all relevant input
data. The mandate of this RTS is similar to the mandate of the Input Data RTS which
requires ESMA to specify how to ensure that input data is appropriate and verifiable. The
mandate under Article 11 also requires ESMA to develop regulatory standards on the
internal oversight and verification procedures for front office contributors. As each RTS
could be waived independently, ESMA considers that both RTS should have sufficient
detail to enable them to stand alone, this means that there are some provisions that may
be found across both RTS.
Q11: Do you agree with this approach? Please explain your response.
111. The Discussion Paper mentioned that in the context of different characteristics of
contributors, the regulatory nature of the contributors to a benchmark is relevant for
55

proportionality. However, taking into consideration the additional requirements for
supervised contributors under the Article 16 RTS, ESMA is of the opinion that
characteristics other than the regulatory nature of contributors should be taken into
consideration in differentiating the requirements established by Article 15 code of conduct
RTS.
Q12: Do you agree with this approach? What are the different characteristics of
contributors that should be taken into consideration in this RTS? How should those
characteristics be taken into account in the provisions suggested in this draft RTS?
Please give examples.
112. In the Discussion Paper, ESMA posed questions regarding the form of the code of
conduct relating to whether the benchmark administrator should have a standard code for
all types of benchmarks or whether the administrator should be mandated to tailor a code
of conduct per benchmark or per economic reality or methodology. The majority of
responses to these questions had the common theme that it should remain the
administrator’s prerogative whether to have a single code of conduct or a tailor made one.
Upon analysis of the responses, and taking into consideration Article 15(3), which states
that administrators may develop a single code of conduct for each family of benchmarks
they provide, ESMA has the opinion that this RTS does not need to add more clarity to
Article 15(3).
113. Technical standards on the provision of input data are specified in various sections of
the RTS which covers policies for ensuring that a contributor provides all relevant input
data, the contribution of input data and the validation of input data. The Discussion Paper
posed suggestions regarding the contributor’s contribution process which were largely
supported by the respondents so ESMA is continuing with this approach.
114. The respondents were asked in the Discussion Paper whether the procedures for
submitting input data were comprehensive. The majority of the respondents agreed that
the list was comprehensive. Some respondents noted that the procedures should only be
regarded if relevant. Another respondent suggested that the contributor should have in
place contingency plans for submitting input data. ESMA agrees with these views. It is the
administrator’s responsibility to suggest the exact procedures so should state the
procedures that are fit for their purpose. The draft RTS includes that contributors shall have
documented contingency plans for submitting input data in the cases of technical and
operational difficulties, temporary absence of authorised submitters and a shortage of
appropriate input data.
115. With regards to validation checks, the majority of respondents supported the proposal
so ESMA has continued with the proposal taking into consideration feedback from the
respondents which included the suggestion of contributors detailing their checks to ensure
that they achieve the levels set out in the code of conduct. ESMA agrees with this
suggestion. A number of respondents disagreed with the prospect of senior management
sign-off for the submissions as this may cause delays in the submissions and that task
could be performed by someone else in the organisation with sufficient market insight. It
56

was also raised that approaches other than the four-eye process can be used as an
effective checking system. ESMA accepts these points that a senior manager may not be
necessary for sign-off and the four-eye process may be substituted for alternate processes
where there are alternate effective checking processes that are appropriate to the nature
and scale of the benchmark and the type of input data contributed and has taken this into
account in the draft RTS. In taking the comments into consideration, ESMA has proposed
standards for automated systems in the draft RTS.
116. The majority of the respondents to the Discussion Paper raised concerns with the
proposal that suggested that the administrator should approve the submitter’s role on
behalf of a contributor and that the administrator have procedures to evaluate a submitter’s
identity. Those respondents had the opinion that it should remain the responsibility of the
contributor to appoint and evaluate the submitters. ESMA agrees with the view of the
respondents. The draft RTS has an article on submitters that provides the minimum
standards that the contributor is expected to adopt when allowing a person to be a
submitter on their behalf.
117. The method of identification of the submitters by the contributor to the administrator
and the method by which the submissions will be authenticated as coming from the
submitter has been suggested to be, in the draft RTS, the responsibility of the administrator
to define. This will enable the administrator to design a process that is fit for their individual
benchmark or benchmark family.
118. The draft RTS sets out the minimum policies to ensure that a contributor shall have in
place to provide all relevant input data. The majority of the respondents agreed that the
contributor’s contribution process should foresee clear rules on the exclusion of data
sources. This view has been reflected in the specifications of what should be included in
the contributor’s input data policy.
119. One respondent suggested that the policies that the contributor needs to have in place
relating to input data should be audited and approved by the administrator. This suggestion
has not been enacted in the RTS as this would have required expansion of Article 15(1)
whereas the mandate of this RTS is to further clarify Article 15(2).
120. The policies, procedures and controls regarding the contribution of input data have
been further specified in the RTS. This section includes a data input policy and policies
regarding the transmission of data to the administrator.
121. The Discussion Paper suggested requirements for the contributor’s contribution
process was supported by the majority of the respondents so ESMA has maintained its
approach in the draft RTS. ESMA has also taken into consideration comments and
suggestions from the respondents. One respondent raised that they would like guidelines
for non-front office contribution as well as front office contribution. In the RTS for the code
of conduct ESMA has decided not to limit the articles to front office contributions and
therefore this RTS will be applicable to all contributions, where appropriate. The RTS on
Input Data will cover more specific requirements for front office contributions.
57

122. The Discussion Paper posed the questions as to whether rules are necessary to
provide consistency of contributor’s behaviour over time and whether or not those rules
should be in the code of conduct or the methodology. The majority of the respondents
agreed with the proposal and out of the respondents who suggested a preference, the
majority stated that the place for these rules would be the code of conduct. The
respondents that disagreed with the rules stated that they did not consider them to be
necessary but if they were then they should not appear in both the code of conduct and
the methodology as these should complement not duplicate each other. ESMA has decided
to place the rules in the code of conduct so that the administrator can set out clear
requirements regarding the behaviour of the contributor and expects that the administrator
will monitor the consistency of the contributor’s behaviour over time.
123. The minimum standards for record keeping, including the recording of the use of expert
judgement, were suggested in the DP. The majority of respondents agreed with the
proposal so ESMA has proceeded with them, taking into account suggestions received
from the respondents including records of disciplinary actions taken against the
contributor’s staff in respect of benchmark-related activities, communication between
submitters and approvers and between the contributor and administrator, substantial
exposures of individual traders or trading desks to benchmark related instruments as well
as changes therein. The respondents that did not agree stated that they disagreed that it
should apply to benchmarks based upon readily available data. It is ESMA’s view that the
RTS on the Code of Conduct will not apply to readily available data benchmarks as they
are not based upon contributions. Another respondent disagreed on the grounds of
proportionality stating that the suggestions were operationally burdensome. ESMA has
taken into consideration proportionality through limiting certain provisions to certain types
of benchmark or contributor.
Q13: Should the substantial exposures of individual traders or trading desk to
benchmark related instruments apply to all types of benchmarks for all contributors?
124. The Discussion Paper suggested that contributors should report suspicious
transactions to compliance, senior management and the administrator as appropriate. The
majority of the respondents agreed with the proposal and a number of respondents
suggested that further to this the contributors should be expected to inform regulatory
authorities about actual or suspected infringements. ESMA agrees with this suggestion
and has proposed that contributors should report the actual or suspected infringements to
the relevant competent authorities including the competent authority of the administrator.
This proposal would ensure that the competent authority of the administrator is fully aware
of any actual or suspected infringements which will strengthen the integrity of the
benchmarks through ensuring that the competent authority that supervises the benchmark
administrator has sufficient information to aid their legal and supervisory duties.
Q14: Do you agree with the proposals for the reporting of suspicious transaction in this
draft RTS? Please explain your answer.

58

125. A proposal was put forward in the DP regarding what should be included in the code of
conduct about the management of conflicts of interest. The majority of the respondents
agreed with the proposals, with suggestions of contributors using a risk register. A couple
of respondents disagreed on the basis that the paragraph in the discussion paper was
unclear and that in some circumstances submitters may not be able to be physically
separated from other employees. On the basis of the responses, ESMA has continued with
the proposal, adding the suggestion for a risk register and adding clarity to the suggestions
including that the physical and operational separation between submitters and other staff
is to occur where reasonably practicable, taking into account the nature, scale and
complexity of the contributor’s activities and whether the contribution activity is based on
the core business or from ancillary activities performed by the contributor.
126. Other questions that were raised in the DP included a query about whether contributors
should be expected to comply with the code of conduct when their contribution is ancillary
to their main business. ESMA has the view that this should not prevent the contributor from
being compliant with the administrator’s code of conduct.
Q15: Are there any provisions that should be added to or amended in the draft RTS to
take into consideration the different characteristics of benchmarks? Please give
examples.
Q16: Do you have any further comments or suggestions relating to the draft RTS on the
code of conduct?

of conduct

COMMISSION DELEGATED REGULATION (EU) No …/..
of XXX
[…]

supplementing Regulation (EU) No 2016/1011 of the European Parliament
and of the Council on indices used as benchmarks in financial instruments
and financial contracts or to measure the performance of investment funds
(Text with EEA relevance)

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EU) No 2016/1011 of the European Parliament and of the Council
of 8 June 2016 on markets benchmarks in financial instruments and financial contracts or to
measure the performance of investment funds and amending Directives 2008/48/EC and
2014/17/EU and Regulation (EU) No 596/201416, and in particular Article 15(6) thereof,
Whereas:
(1)

According to the nature and the economic reality of the underlying market, the
benchmark administrator may establish multiple codes of conduct or a single code of
conduct for all benchmarks provided. Where the administrator develops a single code
of conduct for a benchmark or benchmark family, that code of conduct should be
sufficiently specific to be effective.

(2)

A key component to ensuring the integrity of benchmarks is that contributors appoint
persons to submit the input data that have the correct knowledge, skills, experience and
behaviour to perform the role. As such, this Regulation requires the code of conduct to
specify that contributors should check the background of persons who seek to become
submitters prior to communicating to the administrator the identity of that person as

16

OJ L 171, 29.6.2016, p. 1.

60

someone who the contributor should accept submissions from on the contributor’s
behalf.
(3)

Communication channels between the administrator and the compliance staff of the
contributor are an essential part of the identifying and reporting of suspected
infringements of Regulation (EU) 2016/1011. As such, this Regulation provides that the
contributor should provide contact details of their compliance department.

(4)

In order for a benchmark to be robust, contributors should behave in a consistent manner
when contributing inputs of the required quality, accuracy and quantity. Requirements
in this regulation seek to ensure that these needs are met by the contributor.

(5)

This regulation is based on the draft regulatory technical standards submitted by the
European Securities and Markets Authority to the Commission.

(6)

The European Securities and Markets Authority has conducted open public
consultations on the draft regulatory technical standards on which this Regulation is

HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
Input data
1. The requirements that the administrator lists in the code of conduct regarding the
contribution process shall reflect the methodology for the calculation of the benchmark, and
include:
a) the types of permissible input data to be provided and the hierarchy in which input data
is to be used;
b) the framework for the contributor’s contribution process, including procedures for
adjustments to, and standardisation of, the input data and to address potential errors in
contributions;
c) the frequency for reviews of the framework for the contributor’s contribution process.
2. Guidelines on the contributor’s procedures for internal oversight and verification where
applicable.

17 Regulation

(EU) No 1095/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 November 2010 establishing a European

Supervisory Authority (European Securities and Markets Authority), amending Decision No 716/2009/EC and repealing
Commission Decision 2009/77/EC (OJ L 331, 15.12.2010, p. 84).

Article 2
Submitters
1. The code of conduct shall provide that:
a) Persons shall not submit input data on behalf of the contributor unless that contributor
has satisfied itself that those persons have the necessary skills, knowledge, training and
experience for the duties assigned.
b) Only after the contributor is satisfied on point (a), can a person act as a submitter of
input data on behalf of the contributor.
2. The code of conduct shall outline the due diligence process that the contributor shall
undertake before being satisfied that a person has the necessary skills, knowledge, training
and experience to submit input data on its behalf. This shall include:
a) Checks to verify the identity and qualifications of the potential submitter; and
b) Reference checks, which include reputational aspects such as clarifications as to
whether or not the potential submitter has previously been excluded from submitting to
a benchmark for reasons of misconduct which may have had an impact on the
contribution.
3. The code of conduct shall state the method by which the administrator is to be notified of
the identity of individuals permitted to submit input data on behalf of the contributor.
4. Administrators shall specify in their code of conduct that contributors shall notify the
administrator of the contact details of the contributor’s compliance function.
Article 3
Policies to ensure that a contributor provides all relevant input data
1. The policies that a contributor shall have to provide all relevant input data in accordance
with the administrator’s methodology shall be specified in the code of conduct. These
policies shall include:
a) Input data policy which provides at least:
i) The description of the data that a submitter is permitted to use in determining a
benchmark contribution.
ii) The characteristics of input data that the submitter may exclude from the
contribution and the admitted rationales for the exclusion of such input data.
b) Policies and procedures on the transmission of data to the administrator. These shall
include:
i) the method to be used for a secure data transfer;
ii) the frequency of the transmission, and
iii) contingency plans for submitting input data.
c) The contingency plans for submitting input data under Art 3(1)(b)(iii) shall include:
62

i) technical and operational difficulties;
ii) the temporary absence of submitters, and
iii) a shortage of appropriate input data.

2. The systems and controls that are used in relation to the contribution of input data shall be
reviewed regularly, at least annually.
Article 5
Validation of input data
1. The code of conduct shall state that contributors shall have in place effective systems and
controls to monitor input data. These shall include:
a) pre-contribution checks for suspicious input data;
b) post-contribution checks for suspicious input data, including the monitoring of
communication.
2. The code of conduct shall state that contributors shall record details of the checks that are
undertaken by the contributor in validation of the input data to demonstrate that they achieve
the levels set out in the code of conduct.
3. Any validations to be required by the code of conduct shall be appropriate to the nature and
scale of the benchmark and to the type of input data contributed. These shall include precontribution checks such as:
a) effective checking processes such as four-eyed checks, and
b) identification of abnormal trades.
4. Administrators that permit the use of automated systems for the purpose of providing the
benchmark submission, shall specify in the code of conduct that where the manager of the
contributor signs-off the automated system, that manager shall satisfy themselves that the
automated system is fit for purpose and its effectiveness is able to be monitored on a
continuous basis.
5. Where paragraph 4 is applicable, software update checks for the automated systems shall
take place for automated systems prior to contributing input data.
63

Article 6
Record keeping policies
1. The code of conduct shall require contributors to keep records for at least five years in an
easily accessible form and in a manner that has adequate safeguards against tampering.
These records shall be made available to the administrator upon request: The minimum
information to be kept is:
a) policies and procedures governing the contributions and relevant changes therein;
b) data inputs considered, data excluded and any other exercise of discretion for each
benchmark contribution;
c) communications between the contributor and administrator;
d) relevant communications between the submitters and persons performing checks within
the contributor;

6. Governance and control requirements for supervised
contributors (Article 16 BMR)
6.1. Mandate
Article 16
[…]
5. ESMA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify further the requirements
concerning governance, systems and controls, and policies set out in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3.
ESMA shall take into account the different characteristics of benchmarks and supervised
contributors, in particular in terms of differences in input data provided and methodologies
used, the risks of manipulation of the input data and the nature of the activities carried out by
the supervised contributors, and the developments in benchmarks and financial markets in
light of international convergence of supervisory practices in relation to benchmarks. However,
the ESMA draft regulatory technical standards shall not cover or apply to supervised
contributors of non-significant benchmarks.
ESMA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by
1 April 2017.
127. Article 16 BMR requires ESMA to develop draft RTS to specify further the requirements
concerning systems and control for supervised contributors set out in paragraphs 1, 2 and
3 for different types of benchmarks.
128. The scope of application of the mandate is specified as not extending to contributors to
non-significant benchmarks. Furthermore, paragraph 5 of Annex 1 BMR states that the
mandate does not cover interest rate benchmarks: instead paragraphs 6 to 12 of Annex 1
contain rules specifically for contributors to interest rate benchmarks.
129. ESMA's proposals in this section should be considered alongside the proposals on the
code of conduct (Article 15 BMR), to which contributors will also be subject, and the
proposals on input data (Article 11 BMR), as the requirements on supervised contributors
all relate to the provision of input data.

6.2. Discussion Paper
130. The Discussion Paper contained detailed proposals for general requirements for
supervised contributors, including on oversight, process, conflict of interest, in ten bullet
points. ESMA also made specific proposals for requirements in relation to submitters, the
individuals within supervised contributors responsible for submitting input data. These
included proposals on training for submitters over and above that specified in
Article 16(2)(b) BMR, and on separation of submitters from others in the organisation.
67

131. The Discussion paper also contained detailed proposals on signing off contributions,
and on policies guiding any use of expert judgement or exercise of discretion.

6.3. Analysis following feedback from stakeholders
132. Overall the responses to the proposals were broadly positive, though many contained
suggestions for changes.
133. In relation to the proposed general requirements, suggestions adopted by ESMA
included:
i.

Specifying that "oversight" should include risk management

ii.

Adding conflict of interest "procedures" to conflict of interest "policies"

134. There were a number of responses to the proposal to specify that information about
breaches and audits should be made available to the benchmark administrator. On
reflection, ESMA concluded that this was unnecessary, as Article 16(4) BMR provides that
a supervised contributor should make available to the administrator all of the information
and records kept in accordance with the requirements.
135. On the proposals in relation to submitters almost all respondents agreed with the
proposition that supervised contributors should ensure that submitters were not
incentivised to manipulate indices or to maximise their contributions. But there were
differing views on the details of the proposals for achieving this. Taking these into account,
ESMA decided to elaborate the rules for avoiding incentivising manipulation, including
through remuneration policy and separation from other staff, while not pursuing its idea of
requiring remuneration policy to incentivise the "quality" of submissions or management of
conflicts of interest.
136. Several responses to the proposals on sign-off of individual contributions argued that
there are many cases when individual sign-off of every submission would be
disproportionate, ESMA notes that Article 16(2)(a) BMR already qualifies the requirement
for individual sign-off as "where proportionate". In light of the responses, ESMA has
allowed for circumstances where sign-off might follow submission, and required clear rules
and deadlines to be included, but has not itself specified rules or fixed deadlines.
137. Almost all responses supported ESMA's proposals in relation to policies guiding any
use of expert judgement or exercise of discretion, and so ESMA maintains those proposals.
138. The responses included a number of proposals for categorising different types and
characteristics of benchmarks and of supervised contributors. In the light of those, ESMA
is proposing that some of the more detailed requirements (for timing of sign-off and for reassessment of submitters' suitability) should apply only to critical benchmarks.

68

6.4. Proposal
139. Taking into account all the responses as above, ESMA proposes that the general
systems and controls should ensure:
i.

identification of submitters and alternates

ii.

effective checks of contributions by staff other than the submitter

iii.

where sign-off has to follow submission – as may for example happen where
there are frequent, automated contributions – clear rules and deadlines

iv. periodic review of the process and effective oversight
v.

management of conflict of interest

vi. management of breaches of the Benchmarks Regulation and of the code of
conduct
140. ESMA's proposals include more detailed treatment of the way in which input data is
contributed, with provisions about the submitters, the individuals who contribute the input
data. Submitters must have an understanding of the market or economic reality that the
benchmark represents, and must be trained in the firm's conflicts of interest policy and on
the applicable code of conduct. The training specified in these technical standards will be
in addition to the training on the Benchmarks Regulation and the Market Abuse Regulation
already required by Article 16(2)(b) of the former. For critical benchmarks, the firm should
check at least once a year that each submitter still meets the required standards.
141. Article 16(2)(c) BMR requires organisational separation of submitters "where
appropriate". ESMA proposes to specify that firms should also aim to separate submitters
from other employees physically, and should have oversight and verification procedures in
relation to possible submitters' conflicts of interests. Where separation is not possible,
these procedures should be such as to control the interaction of submitters with front office
employees. And a firm's remuneration policies should avoid giving submitters any
incentives that might affect their contributions.
142. In relation to contributions that involve the use of expert judgement, ESMA proposes
that each supervised contributor's procedure for applying expert judgement should include
a framework for ensuring consistency in contributions, and specification of the information
to be used. There should also be procedures for reviewing the use of expert judgement
afterwards.
143. ESMA also proposes some elaboration of the requirements in Article 16(2)(d) and (e)
BMR for record-keeping by the supervised contributor.

69

Q17: Do you agree with the draft technical standards in relation to the governance and
control arrangements for supervised contributors to benchmarks? Please provide
reasons.
Q18: In particular, can you identify specific aspects of the draft Regulation that should
be applied differentially to different supervised contributors in particular in terms of
differences in input data provided and methodologies used, the risks of manipulation
of the input data and the nature of the activities carried out by the supervised
contributors?

6.6. Draft technical standards: Governance and control requirements
for supervised contributors

COMMISSION DELEGATED REGULATION (EU) No …/...
of […]
supplementing Regulation (EU) No 2016/1011 of the European Parliament
and of the Council with regard to regulatory technical standards on the
governance and control arrangements for supervised contributors to
benchmarks

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EU) No 2016/1011 of the European Parliament and of the Council
of 8 June 2016 on indices used as benchmarks in financial instruments and financial contracts
or to measure the performance of investment funds and amending Directives 2008/48/EC and
2014/17/EU and Regulation (EU) No 596/201418, and in particular Article 16(5) thereof,
Whereas:
(1)

In order to ensure that there is appropriate oversight and monitoring of the process for
making contributions, this Regulation specifies appropriate monitoring of contributions.
Recognising that there may be processes where sign-off in advance of individual
contributions may be disproportionate, as for example where contributions are made
many times a day by an automated system, this Regulation provides for alternative
checks that cater for such circumstances.

(2)

It is important to minimise the exposure of submitters to incentives to manipulate
benchmarks, and this Regulation therefore includes further details on the separation of
submitters from other employees; on the procedures that will control the interaction of
submitters with front office employees; and on the supervised contributor's
remuneration policy for submitters to ensure that it cannot incentivise manipulation.

(3)

In order to ensure that the required record-keeping fulfils the purpose of enabling the
supervised contributor, or the administrator or national competent authority, to review
the way in which controls have been applied and to carry out any necessary
investigations, this Regulation specifies further that the requirement to keep records of
communications in relation to provision of input data should include the identities of

18

OJ L 171, 29.6.2016, p. 1.

71

those involved, which would include for example the author and recipients of any
written communication, and the participants in any recorded telephone conversations.
(4)

This Regulation is based on the draft regulatory technical standards submitted by the
European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) to the Commission.

(5)

ESMA has conducted open public consultations on the draft regulatory technical
standards on which this Regulation is based, analysed the potential related costs and
benefits and requested the opinion of the Securities and Markets Stakeholder Group
established by Article 37 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 of the European Parliament
and of the Council19,

HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:

Article 1
Governance, systems and controls
1. The systems and controls that a supervised contributor shall have in place to ensure the
integrity, accuracy and reliability of all contributions of input data to the administrator shall
include a documented and effective process for contributing data, with at least the following
features:
(a) a process for identification of submitters, and procedures for making contributions
when a submitter is unexpectedly unavailable, including the identification of
alternates;
(b) policies, procedures and systems for monitoring the data used for the contributions,
and the contributions, which should
(i) where it is proportionate for the controls to include a process for sign-off by a
natural person senior to the submitter, include clear rules about the timing of the
sign-off, and if this includes the possibility of sign-off after submission of the
input data, the circumstances in which this is permitted and the deadlines for signoff should be stated.
(ii) where it is not proportionate to include a process for such sign-off, provide for
effective checks of the contribution to be carried out by staff other than the
submitter who have sufficient knowledge, understanding and status to be able to
challenge proposed or actual contributions; The frequency and timing of these
checks should be specified taking into account the frequency of submission, the
level of discretion involved in the process, and the nature, scale and complexity
of the contributor's activities.

19

Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 November 2010 establishing a European
Supervisory Authority (European Securities and Markets Authority), amending Decision No 716/2009/EC and repealing
Commission Decision 2009/77/EC (OJ L 331, 15.12.2010, p. 84).

72

(iii) be capable of producing alerts in line with predefined parameters in order to allow
for further analysis to be conducted.
2.

The systems and controls shall include:
(a) periodic review of the process for contributing data;
(b) effective oversight of the process for contributing data including risk management,
identification of senior personnel accountable for the process, and involvement, where
appropriate, of the compliance function and internal audit;
(c) policy and procedures for management of conflicts of interest, which should include
maintenance of a conflicts of interest register;
(d) a policy on whistleblowing, including appropriate safeguards for whistle-blowers.

3. The systems and controls shall contain a procedure for detecting and managing breaches
of Regulation (EU) No 2016/1011 or of the code of conduct required by Article 15 of that
Regulation. The procedure for managing breaches shall include reviewing any detected breach
or error, and recording actions taken as a consequence with a view to improving the supervised
contributors’ processes so as to avoid repetition.
4. Subparagraphs (i) and (ii) of paragraph 1(b) shall apply only in the case of contributions to
critical benchmarks.
Article 2
Process of contribution of input data
1.

The systems and controls shall include processes and policies to ensure that each submitter:
(a) has adequate knowledge and experience to understand the underlying market or
economic reality the benchmark is intended to measure; and
(b) receives adequate training on the firm’s conflicts of interest policy and on the code of
conduct for the relevant benchmark,

2. At least once a year all submitters' understanding and knowledge should be re-assessed to
verify that it is still appropriate that they act as submitters.
3. The measures for the management of conflict of interest in the systems and controls should
include:
(a) physical separation of submitters from other employees working in other business
units within the contributor's organisational structure, where reasonably practicable,
taking into account the nature, scale and complexity of the contributor’s activities and
whether the contribution activity is based on the core business or on ancillary activities
performed by the contributor; and
(b) appropriate internal oversight and verification procedures; when there is no
organisational or physical separation of employees, the oversight and verification
procedures shall aim at controlling particularly the interaction of submitters with front
office employees.

73

4. Those measures should also include remuneration policies in relation to submitters that
ensure that the remuneration of a submitter:
(a) is not linked to the benchmark nor to the submissions made; and
(b) is independent of the performance of any other business unit of the contributor that is
likely to be significantly affected by the benchmark.
5. Paragraph 2 shall not apply in the case of contributions to significant benchmarks or to
commodity benchmarks that are not critical.
Article 3
Expert judgement
Where input data relies on expert judgement, the policies guiding the use of judgement or the
exercise of discretion shall include at least the following:
(a) the framework for ensuring consistency between different submitters, and consistency
over time;
(b) identification of the information that could be used to support the use of expert
judgement, and of any information that must not be taken into account;
(c) procedures for systematic retrospective reviews of the application of expert judgement.
Article 4
Record keeping
1. In keeping records of communications in relation to provision of input data the supervised
contributor shall include the contributions made and the names of the submitters.
2. In keeping records of the contributor's exposure to financial instruments which use a
benchmark as a reference, the supervised contributor shall include information on whether the
holding of the instruments is part of the core activity of the contributor or is the result of treasury
financing activity.
3. In keeping records of internal and external audits, the supervised contributor shall include,
where applicable, the audit brief, the audit report, and a record of actions taken in response to
each audit.
Article 5
Entry into force
This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in
the Official Journal of the European Union.
It shall apply from 1 January 2018.
This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.

7. Criteria for significant benchmarks (Article 25 BMR)
7.1. Mandate
Article 25
3. A competent authority may decide that the administrator of the significant benchmark is
nevertheless to apply one or more of the requirements of Articles 4(2), points (c), (d) and (e)
of Article 4(7), point (b) of Article 11(3) and Article 15(2) if it considers that it would be
appropriate taking into account the nature or the impact of the benchmarks or the size of the
administrator. In its assessment, the competent authority shall, based on the information
provided by the administrator, take into account the following criteria:
a.

the vulnerability of the benchmark to manipulation;

b.

the nature of the input data;

c.

the level of conflicts of interest;

d.

the degree of discretion of the administrator;

e.

the impact of the benchmark on markets;

f.

the nature, scale and complexity of the provision of the benchmark;

g.

the importance of the benchmark to financial stability;

h.

the value of financial instruments, financial contracts or investment funds that
reference the benchmark;

i.

the administrator’s size, organisational form or structure.

8. ESMA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to further specify the criteria
referred to in paragraph 3.
ESMA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 1 April
2017.

7.2. Criteria for the assessment by National Competent Authorities
144. Administrators of significant benchmarks may choose not to apply a number of
provisions of the Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 regarding the avoidance of conflicts of interest
through organisational separation of the benchmark provision from other business or
through increased control measures on their employees, regarding control mechanisms for
input data contributed from a front office function and regarding minimum contents of the
code of conduct for contributors.
76

145. Where an administrator has chosen not to apply one or more provisions, the competent
authority may decide that the administrator shall nevertheless apply one or more of the
respective provisions if it considers that it would be appropriate and has taken into account
the nature or the impact of the benchmark or the size of the administrator as well as nine
criteria set forth in Article 25(3) of Regulation (EU) No 2016/1011, which ESMA is required
to further specify.
146. In its Discussion Paper ESMA proposed its initial draft clarification of the criteria and
developed indications for the relevance of some of the criteria in the assessment process
to be conducted by the competent authorities, taking into account the purpose of the
provisions that are eligible for an opt-out by administrators of significant benchmarks , as
well as the benchmarks’ potential proneness to manipulation and potential indications for
their decreased robustness, resulting from the administrator’s size, organisational
structure, business activities other than the benchmark provision or other aspects.
147. Respondents generally agreed with ESMA’s initial approach but pointed out that certain
considerations had not met the reality of all administrator’s business activities. ESMA
should additionally reflect upon the experience and expertise an administrator has in the
provision of benchmarks and whether the administrator is an independent provider. The
role of the provider should also be considered when the competent authority is suggested
to look at past cases of manipulation. On the administrator’s involvement in the market the
benchmark is intended to measure, respondents stressed that ESMA should make clear
that a conflict of interest could particularly evolve where the administrator holds positions
in that specific market.
148. Some respondents also argued that ESMA should not indicate an outcome of the
assessments the competent authorities will have to make at all. Respondents also argued
that the elaborations in the Discussion Paper suggest that every decision by administrators
of significant benchmarks to opt out of the application of one or more provisions according
to Article 25 of the Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 would be subject to an approval by the
relevant competent authority while the principle of proportionality in the Regulation would
allow an opt out. Any decision to impose the application of the respective provisions should
be exceptional and it would be the competent authority’s burden to demonstrate the
appropriateness of such a decision.
149. In developing the draft technical standards ESMA has reflected on the comments on
the Discussion Paper and considers that each criterion should be assessed taking into
account the purpose of the provision which the administrator has decided not to apply and
should evaluate if such purpose can nonetheless be achieved through other means.
150. The criteria of the vulnerability of the benchmark to manipulation, the nature of the input
data and of the nature, scale and complexity of the provision of the benchmark (Article
25(3)(a), (b) and (f) of the Regulation (EU) 2016/1011) address aspects that are inherent
to the benchmark itself and to its methodology respectively. ESMA suggests that the
competent authority in assessment of these criteria should take into account in particular
structural elements of the benchmark to evaluate whether or not individual characteristics
77

of the benchmark or its actual provision process may justify to require the application of
one or more of the requirements the administrator has opted out of. For the mentioned
criteria, the requirements regarding the input data (Article 4(7) of the Regulation (EU)
2016/1011 can be of particular relevance.
151. The level of conflicts of interest, the degree of discretion of the administrator and the
administrator’s size, organisational form or structure (letters (c), (d) and (i) of Article 25 of
the Regulation (EU) 2016/1011) relate foremost to the properties of the administrator and
the specifying elements in the RTS point to typical sources of conflicts of interest – for
example whether the administrator holds positions in financial instruments or financial
contracts referencing the benchmark, its involvement with contributors or its corporate ties
to actual or potential users of the benchmark – and possible means to mitigate them –
through transparency, organisational separation or other adequate governance
mechanisms. The elements developed by ESMA should be particularly helpful for
competent authorities when they assess the re-application of requirements concerning
governance and conflicts of interest avoidance (Articles 4(2) and 4(7)(c), (d) and (e) of the
Regulation (EU) 2016/1011).
152. The remaining criteria of the impact of the benchmark on markets, the importance of
the benchmark to financial stability and of the value of financial instruments, financial
contracts or investment funds that reference the benchmark (letters (e), (g) and (h) of
Article 25(3) of the Regulation (EU) 2016/1011) all relate to the financial importance of the
benchmark – to either single markets or to financial stability on a wider scale. ESMA
suggests in the RTS for the competent authorities to include respective elements in the
assessment of the appropriateness of mandating the re-application of one or more
requirements of the Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 and to consider the relevance the
individual benchmark has or may have for a specific market or markets and – where known
by the competent authority, through the application process or otherwise – the total value
of financial instruments, financial contracts and investment funds referencing that
benchmark, and any relevant quantitative relation to the total value of the respective
instruments in the Member State, where available.
Q19: Do you agree with ESMA’s specifications of the criteria?

8 June 2016 on indices used as benchmarks in financial instruments and financial contracts or
to measure the performance of investment funds and amending Directives 2008/48/EC and
2014/17/EU and Regulation (EU) No 596/201420, and in particular Article 25(9) thereof,
Whereas:
(1)

Administrators of significant benchmarks may opt not to apply one or more provisions
of the Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 that would otherwise be applicable to the type of
benchmark they provide. The competent authority may decide that administrators have
to apply one or more requirements the disapplication of which they have communicated
to the competent authority, if the nature or the impact of the benchmark or the size of
the administrator so justifies.

(2)

Competent authorities have to take into account a number of criteria when they asses
the appropriateness of applying one or more requirements of the Regulation (EU)
2016/1011 which the administrator has previously chosen not to apply. It is important
that these criteria are further specified to make their assessment by the competent
authority more practical and to ensure their coherent application in all Member States.
This Regulation sets forth elements for each criterion which further define its relevance
in the context of Article 25 (3) of the Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 and which competent
authorities shall consider in their assessment.

(3)

The further specification of the criteria is based on the nature of the provisions that
administrators may waive when they provide significant benchmarks. Administrators of

20

OJ 171, 29.6.2016, p.1.

79

significant benchmarks may elect not to operationally separate the provision of
benchmarks from other parts of their business that may create an actual or potential
conflict of interest. Administrators of significant benchmarks may also not apply
provisions that prevent their employees and any other natural persons working for them,
who are directly involved in the provision of a benchmark, from a number of situations
and activities that could create a risk of conflicts of interest and an incentive to
manipulation. Competent authorities should take account of these exceptions when they
assess the criteria of Article 25(3) of the Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 in light of potential
conflicts of interests. When administrators of significant benchmarks decide not to apply
additional control measures for input data from front office functions or to develop the
code of conduct without the minimum contents of Article 15(2) of the Regulation (EU)
2016/1011 competent authorities in their assessment should evaluate if the robustness
and quality of input data is achieved by other means.
(4)

This Regulation is based on the draft regulatory technical standards submitted by the
European Securities and Markets Authority to the Commission.

(5)

The European Securities and Markets Authority has conducted open public
consultations on the draft regulatory technical standards on which this Regulation is
based, analysed the potential related costs and benefits and requested the opinion of the
Securities Markets Stakeholder Group established in accordance with Article 37 of
Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council21.

HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
Assessment of the appropriateness of applying specific requirements to administrators
of significant benchmarks
1. When deciding whether an administrator of a significant benchmark is to apply one or more
of the requirements laid down in Article 4(2), points (c), (d) and (e) of Article 4(7), point (b) of
Article 11(3) and Article 15(2) of Regulation (EU) 2016/1011, the competent authority shall
take into account the following elements:
(a)

in relation to the vulnerability of the benchmark to manipulation:
(i) whether the benchmark is based on transaction data, whether contributors are
supervised entities or whether additional measures apply that increase the
robustness of input data;

21

Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 November 2010
establishing a European Supervisory Authority (European Securities and Markets Authority), amending Decision
No 716/2009/EC and repealing Commission Decision 2009/77/EC (OJ L 331, 15.12.2010, p. 84).

80

(ii) whether the administrator’s organisational structure prevents incentives to
manipulation and whether the administrator has a financial interest in financial
instruments, financial contracts or investment funds referencing the benchmark;
(iii) whether there are proven cases of manipulation of the same benchmark or a
benchmark with a similar methodology provided by an administrator of similar
size and organisational structure;
(iv) whether there are specific incentives for a third party to try to manipulate the
benchmark;
(b)

in relation to the nature of the input data:
(i) when the input data is transaction data, whether the administrator is a participant
in the market or economic reality the benchmark intends to measure;
(ii) when the input data is provided by contributors, whether the contributors hold
positions in financial instruments referencing that benchmark;
(iii) when the input data is sourced from third country exchanges or trading systems,
whether a supervisory framework applicable to these exchanges or trading
systems maintains the integrity of the input data;
(iv) where the input data consists of quotes, whether these are committed or
indicative and whether the quotes are prone to manipulation;

(c)

in relation to the level of conflicts of interest:
(i) whether the administrator holds positions in financial instruments or financial
contracts referencing the benchmark or could profit from the performance of an
investment fund which is measured by the benchmark;
(ii) where the benchmark is based on contributions, how the administrator’s actual
or potential relations with contributors are governed by adequate control
mechanisms;
(iii) Whether the administrator has controls or other measures in place that mitigate
potential conflicts of interest effectively;

(d)

in relation to the degree of discretion of the administrator:
(i) where the benchmark methodology allows for expert judgement by the
administrator, whether its exercise is sufficiently transparent;
(ii) where the benchmark is based on estimates, the effectiveness of internal control
measures the administrator has in place;

(e)

in relation to the impact of the benchmark on markets:
(i) where a benchmark has particular relevance for a specific market or markets,
whether the unreliability of the benchmark has a disruptive effect on the
functioning of that specific market or markets and whether there are adequate
substitutes for that benchmark;
(ii) When the benchmark is a significant benchmark according to Article 24 (1)(b)
of the Regulation (EU) 2016/1011, and where known to the competent authority,
any relevant quantitative relation of financial instruments, financial contracts, or
81

investment funds referencing the benchmark to the total value of the respective
instruments in a Member State;
(f)

in relation to the nature, scale and complexity of the provision of the benchmark:
(i) the degree of which input data is based on contributions or whether the input
data is transaction data and how this is reflected in the control mechanisms the
administrator has in place;
(ii) the amount of data to be processed and the number of data sources and whether
the administrator has sufficient technical means to continuously and robustly
process the data;
(iii) whether the calculation method gives rise to operational risks in processing the
data;
(iv) the extent to which the administrator relies on external contributors for the
determination of the benchmark;

(g)

in relation to the importance of the benchmark to financial stability, the quantitative
relation of the total value of financial instruments, financial contracts and investment
funds referencing the benchmark to the total assets of the financial sector and of the
banking sector in a Member State, where known to the competent authority;

(h)

in relation to the value of financial instruments, financial contracts or investment
funds that reference the benchmark:
(i) the total value of all financial instruments, financial contracts and investment
funds referencing the benchmark on the basis of all the range of maturities or
tenors of the benchmark, where known to the competent authority;
(ii) whether the use of the benchmark is concentrated in individual categories of
financial instruments, financial contracts or investment funds;
(iii)when a benchmark is a significant benchmark according to Article 24 (1)(a) of
the Regulation (EU) 2016/1011, and where known to the competent authority,
the proximity of the total value of referencing financial instruments, financial
contracts and investment funds to the thresholds in points (a) and (c)(i) of Article
20 of the Regulation (EU) 2016/1011;

(i)

in relation to the administrator’s size, organisational form or structure:
(i) when the provision of benchmarks is not the administrator’s principal business
activity, whether the provision of the benchmark is organisationally separate and
whether other appropriate means are in place to avoid conflicts of interest.
(ii) when the administrator is part of a group and where one or more entities within
such a group are actual or potential users of the benchmark, whether the entity
providing the benchmark is acting independently and how appropriate the other
means the administrator has in place are to avoid conflicts of interest.

8 Compliance statement for administrators of significant
and non-significant benchmarks (Articles 25 and 26 BMR)
8.1 Mandate
Article 25
7. Where an administrator of a significant benchmark does not comply with one or more of the
requirements laid down in Article 4(2), points (c), (d) and (e) of Article 4(7), point (b) of
Article 11(3) and Article 15(2), it shall publish and maintain a compliance statement that
clearly states why it is appropriate for that administrator not to comply with those provisions.
8. ESMA shall develop draft implementing technical standards to develop a template for the
compliance statement described in paragraph 7.
ESMA shall submit the draft implementing standards referred to in the first subparagraph to
the Commission by 1 April 2017.
Article 26
3. Where an administrator of a non-significant benchmark chooses not to apply one or more
of the provisions referred to in paragraph 1, it shall publish and maintain a compliance
statement which shall clearly state why it is appropriate for that administrator not to comply
with those provisions. The administrator shall provide the compliance statement to its
competent authority.
4. The relevant competent authority shall review the compliance statement referred to in
paragraph 3 of this Article. The competent authority may also request additional information
from the administrator in respect of its non-significant benchmarks in accordance with
Article 41 and may require changes to ensure compliance with this Regulation.
5. ESMA shall develop draft implementing technical standards to develop a template for the
compliance statement described in paragraph 3.
ESMA shall submit the draft implementing standards referred to in the first subparagraph to
the Commission by 1 April 2017.

8.2 Compliance statement: significant benchmarks
153. The Benchmarks Regulation (BMR) states that administrators of significant
benchmarks may choose not to apply a number of provisions. These provisions, listed in
Article 25(1), relate to the areas of: governance and conflict of interest (Article 4), input
data (Article 11) and code of conduct (Article 15). An administrator may decide not to apply
these requirements only when it “considers that the application of one or more of those
provisions would be disproportionate taking into account the nature or impact of the
benchmark or the size of the administrator” (Article 25(1)). However, the relevant national
competent authority (“NCA”) may conduct an assessment and decide that one or more of
the requirements waived should be applied, depending on the outcome of the said
assessment.

84

154. Where the administrator chooses not to comply with one or more of the provisions listed
in Article 25(1), it has to publish and maintain a compliance statement explaining why it
considers it appropriate not to comply with those provisions.
155. In this context, ESMA is empowered to develop implementing technical standards (ITS)
to develop a template for the compliance statement, to be used by all administrators of
significant benchmarks availing themselves of the provision in Article 25(1). The template
should ensure that the statement is clear and unambiguous, and at the same time the
explanation of the non-application of the provisions should be as detailed and
comprehensive as possible. That is because the main aim of the compliance statement is
to provide competent authorities and the public with an explanation of why it is appropriate
not to apply some requirements of the BMR: transparency and clarity should therefore be
prominent features of the template for compliance statements.
156. In the Discussion Paper (DP), ESMA argued that a statement should refer to a single
benchmark / family of benchmarks. According to the proposal of the DP, if an administrator
decides not to apply some provisions to, e.g., three different benchmarks (not belonging to
the same family of benchmarks), it should publish three separate statements (see para.
252 of the DP).
157. The DP already included a list of eleven items that ESMA was proposing to include in
the compliance statement.
158. The respondents to the DP agreed with the items preliminary proposed by ESMA and
suggested that no other items should be added. They were, however, in disagreement with
the proposal of having a single compliance statement for each benchmark / family of
benchmarks, and they suggested that a single compliance statement should be required
for multiple benchmarks in cases where the same rationale for non-compliance exists, even
if such benchmarks are not part of the same family.
159. In light of the feedback received, ESMA is now proposing in the draft ITS that
administrators of significant benchmarks should publish a single compliance statement
composed of multiple sections. First, a “general” section should include the identity of the
administrator and of the relevant NCA as well as the date of creation and latest update of
the compliance statement.
160. After the “general” section, the compliance statement should contain a “core” section
including:
a. an indication to which significant benchmarks the waived provisions do not apply;
b. which provisions the administrator has chosen not to apply;
c. explanations on the appropriateness of not applying each of the provisions waived.
161. This “core” section should be included in the compliance statement for each identifiable
group of significant benchmarks (whether or not belonging to the same family) provided by
85

the administrator for which: (i) the same provisions are not complied with, and (ii) the same
explanations for non-compliance apply.
162. For example, if an administrator of five significant benchmarks decides not to apply one
of the requirements listed in Article 25(1) in the provision of three benchmarks, it would
have to explain in the compliance statement why the application of that requirement is
disproportionate in relation to those three benchmarks. In the case where the explanation
of disproportionality is the same for the three benchmarks, the compliance statement of
the administrator would be composed of: one “general” section and one “core” section, in
which the three benchmarks are listed and the common explanation of appropriateness is
included.
163. If the same administrator decides that for its remaining two significant benchmarks a
different requirement, amongst the ones listed in Article 25(1), should not apply, it should
check whether the reason for not applying this requirement to the two benchmarks is
identical. If this is the case, the compliance statement of the administrator would thus
include: a “general” section and two distinct “core” sections – a first “core” section for the
group of three benchmarks referred to in the previous paragraph, and a second “core”
section for the group of two benchmarks referred to in this paragraph.
164. In case the explanations for the non-application of one provision differ from one
benchmark to another, in the second example provided, there would be a need to add an
additional “core” section. In this case the result would be a compliance statement that
includes: a “general” section and three distinct “core” sections - a first “core” section for the
group of three benchmarks, a second “core” section for one of the two benchmarks
belonging to the second group, and a third “core” section for the other benchmark of the
second group. Indeed, even if the administrator applies the same exemption to several
benchmarks, whenever the explanations for doing so are different, separate core sections
are requested.
165. With this approach ESMA is aiming at minimising the administrative burden in
connection with preparation of the compliance statement, while maintaining all the relevant
information, in line with the Level 1 text.
166. The draft ITS requires an administrator of significant benchmarks also to amend the
compliance statement whenever any of the information included within it is no longer up to
date. This could be the case, for example, if a significant benchmark is to be added to the
ones already included in the statement. After each amendment, the administrator of
significant benchmarks should then publish the updated compliance statement (with a
modified date of “last update” in the general section of the statement).

8.3 Compliance statement: non-significant benchmarks
167. In relation to non-significant benchmarks, the BMR has a similar approach towards
possible non application of some requirements. According to Article 26(1) of the BMR,
when a benchmark is not classified as critical or significant, its administrator may decide
86

not to apply a number of provisions indicated under the same Article and related to:
governance and conflict of interest (Article 4), oversight function (Article 5), control
framework (Article 6), accountability framework (Article 7), input data (Article 11),
transparency of methodology (Article 13), reporting of infringement (Article 14), code of
conduct (Article 15), governance and control requirements for supervised contributors
(Article 16).
168. If an administrator decides not to apply any of the provisions listed in Article 26(1), it
will have to publish and maintain a statement explaining why it is appropriate not to comply
with the specific provisions.
169. The main difference with respect to the process for significant benchmarks is that in the
case of non-significant benchmarks:
a. there is no assessment by the competent authority of the appropriateness of the
exemptions elected by the administrator (see Article 25(2) to (6) for significant
benchmarks);
b. the compliance statement should also be provided to the relevant competent
authority;
c. the competent authority may require additional information as well as changes to
ensure compliance with the BMR (see Article 26(4));
170. Also in this context ESMA is empowered to develop draft ITS to establish a template
for the compliance statement to be produced for non-significant benchmarks.
171. ESMA DP was proposing that the compliance statement for significant and nonsignificant benchmarks should have the same structure. The new draft ITS proposes a
single compliance statement composed of multiple sections also in the case of
administrators of non-significant benchmarks. The way the statement should be composed
is exactly the same as for significant benchmarks.
172. In the case of non-significant benchmarks, the responses to the DP also suggested that
administrators of non-significant benchmarks should have less burdensome compliance
statements than administrators of significant ones.
173. Following the suggestion by market participants, and in line with the principle of
proportionality, the draft ITS proposes for administrators of non-significant benchmarks a
reduced number of items compared to the statement for significant benchmarks, while
keeping the multiple sections structure. The goal is to reduce even further the
administrative burden for administrators of non-significant benchmarks, while still providing
for a compliance statement able to properly inform the relevant NCA and the public.
Q20: Do you agree with the content and structure of the two compliance statement
templates? If not, please explain.

8.4 Draft technical standards: Compliance statement

COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING REGULATION (EU) No …/... laying down
implementing technical standards with regard to the template for compliance statements
to be used by administrators of significant and non-significant benchmarks according to
Regulation (EU) No 2016/1011 of the European Parliament and of the Council
of XXX
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EU) No 2016/1011 of the European Parliament and of the Council
of 8 June 2016 on indices used as benchmarks in financial instruments and financial contracts
or to measure the performance of investment funds and amending Directives 2008/48/EC and
2014/17/EU and Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 22 and in particular Articles 25(8) and 26(5)
thereof,
Whereas:
(1)

It is important that the compliance statement published and maintained by an
administrator of significant and/or non-significant benchmarks is clear, so as to provide
the public and the relevant national competent authority with the information
contemplated by the Regulation.

(2)

Each compliance statement should be organised in sections, each of them referring to
an identified group of benchmarks for which the same provisions are not complied with,
and the same explanation for non-compliance apply. Each of these sections should
contain, for each provision the administrator has choosen not to apply, a dedicated and
sufficiently detailed statement of the reasons why the administrator considers it
appropriate not to comply with that specific provision for the group of benchamrks in
question.

(3)

In relation to significant benchmarks, such explanation should focus on the reasons why
the application of that single provision would be disproportionate in light of the
relevance of the benchmark, the nature of the input data used, the size, organisational
form or structure of the administrator, or any other element the administrator considers
relevant for the purpose of the compliance statement.

(4)

In accordance with the principle of proportionality, this Regulation avoids putting an
excessive administrative burden on administrators of non-significant benchmarks by
developing a template for the compliance statements of administrators of nonsignificant benchmarks that is less detailed.

9.1 Mandate
Article 27
3. ESMA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to further specify the contents of
the benchmark statement and the cases in which an update of such statement is required,
distinguishing for different types of benchmarks and sectors as set in this Regulation and taking
into account the principle of proportionality.
ESMA shall submit the draft implementing standards referred to in the first subparagraph to
the Commission by 1 April 2017.

9.2 General remarks and feedback
174. Article 27 of the Benchmarks Regulation (BMR) requires administrators to publish a
benchmark statement. Article 27(1) states general requirements regarding transparency,
appropriateness, and elements of discretion in the calculation of the benchmark and user
caution. The minimum contents for all benchmark statements are specified in Article 27(2)
with reference to the methodology and the process to determine the benchmark, in
particular the input data.
175. Recital 43 of the Regulation explains that the benchmark statement is a tool for users
of benchmarks to choose appropriately from among, and understand the risks of,
benchmarks, and for this reason the statement provides information in relation to what a
given benchmark intends to measure and its susceptibility to manipulation. The main aim
of the statement is therefore to provide clear information to the public, informing it in a
precise yet “user friendly” way.
176. The Discussion Paper (DP) provided some first proposals in relation to the general
information of the benchmark statement, further specifying the contents laid down in Level
1, as well as specific requirements for different types of benchmarks.
177. In particular, the DP proposed enhanced disclosure requirements in relation to critical
benchmarks with reference to: the degree of use of the critical benchmark in general and
also with regard to different Member States, the nature of its contributors and their location,
information on the most relevant types of financial instruments / contracts and investment
funds that reference the critical benchmark, and the total reference value for this
benchmark (see section 11.5.1 of the DP).
178. In relation to interest rate and commodity benchmarks, the DP proposed to include in
the benchmark statement information about the specific requirements that the BMR impose
on them due to their classification as interest rate or commodity benchmarks (see sections
11.4.1 and 11.4.2 of the DP).

95

179. The market participants’ feedback on the proposals of the DP was generally positive.
However, the respondents highlighted some concerns related to a small number of issues.
180. Market participants are generally worried about the duplication of information to be
published by benchmark administrators under different BMR obligations. They see in
particular an overlap between the information provided by the benchmark statement and
the methodology to be published or made available by the administrator (Article 13 BMR).
ESMA acknowledges that the two documents (methodology and benchmark statement)
contain the same type of information to a certain extent. It is nevertheless clear that the
requirement to publish both documents stems from the BMR, and therefore the proposal
by some respondents to include the benchmark statement into the methodology, or vice
versa, is not a viable option. Also, the possibility for the benchmarks statement to refer to
the methodology document without repeating the same information is not something that
ESMA can consider: Recital 43 explains that benchmark statements must be of reasonable
length but at the same time must focus on providing the key information needed to users
in an easily accessible manner, i.e. cross reference to other documents should be as
limited as possible.
181. In relation to the specification of point (a) under Article 27(1), respondents suggested
to add some flexibility to the definition of the circumstances in which the measurement of
the market / economic reality of the benchmarks may become unreliable. A statement to
this effect was added in the draft RTS (see Article 1(2)(c) of the draft RTS).
182. In relation to the explanation of the use of discretion in the calculation of the
benchmarks, the main concern of respondents was again the duplication of information
already included in other documents. The BMR in this respect is already very specific (see
point (b) of Article 27(1) of the BMR: the benchmark statement should “lay down technical
specifications that clearly and unambiguously identify the elements of the calculation of the
benchmark in relation to which discretion may be exercised, the criteria applicable to the
exercise of such discretion and the position of the persons that can exercise discretion,
and how such discretion may be subsequently evaluated”). ESMA cannot reduce the
content of point (b) of Article 27(1) of the BMR, and therefore the suggestions made in
relation to the discretion used in the calculation have not been included in the draft RTS.
183. The DP proposed for both significant and non-significant benchmarks to include a
reference to the compliance statement, where applicable. The DP also proposed three
options to include this reference in the benchmark statement and was asking for the public
preference. Respondents generally opposed the inclusion of information about the
compliance statement in the benchmark statement because of the duplication of available
information, as the compliance statement will be published and therefore available to
everybody, just like the benchmark statement.
184. In light of the feedback received to this proposal, and the fact that Article 27 of the BMR
does not make any reference to the compliance statement, ESMA has decided to change
its approach and consequently the draft RTS does not contain any requirement to make
reference to the compliance statement.
96

9.3 Content of the draft RTS
185. On the basis of the proposal included in the DP, and taking into account the concerns
and suggestions submitted by the respondents, ESMA has prepared a draft RTS for the
benchmark statement. The draft RTS has been organised as follows:


Article 1 specifies the items included under Article 27(1) of the BMR;



Articles 2 to 7 specify the items included under Article 27(2) of the BMR in
relation to the different types of benchmarks; and



Article 8 specifies the cases in which an update of the benchmarks statement
is required.

186. ESMA has developed this structure of the RTS so as to propose a linear and easily
understandable set of requirements that administrators should be able to implement
smoothly, without an excessive increase in administrative cost.
General disclosure requirements
187. Article 1 of the draft RTS further specifies points (a) to (d) of Article 27(1) of the BMR.
In relation to point (a) of Article 27 (1), Article 1 requires the benchmark statement to include
a reference to the geographical boundaries of the measured market or economic reality as
part of the general definition of the market or economic reality measured by the
benchmarks.
188. The DP also proposed that the benchmark statement includes: information on actual or
potential participants of the measured market, barriers to market access, an indication of
the size of the measured market or economic reality. However, in response to some
concerns expressed by market participants with respect to the availability of reliable data,
the aforementioned elements have been included in the draft RTS only as factors to be
considered by the administrator.
189. Point (a) of Article 27 (1) of the BMR refers also to the “circumstances in which the
measurement of the benchmark may become unreliable”, and Article 1(2) of the draft RTS
includes indicators that administrators should take into account when they define these
circumstances.
190. Article 1(3) focuses on the use of discretion in the calculation of a benchmark (point (b)
of Article 27(1) BMR). It is important that a benchmark statement includes clear and
complete description of any element of discretion in the calculation, because the
susceptibility to the manipulation of the benchmark is clearly linked to the use of discretion
in the calculation. The draft RTS proposes that the benchmark statement should:


identify each individual element of the benchmark determination process that is
or may be subject to or indispensably require discretion, and describe, in
97

relation to each individual element, under what conditions, if any, discretion may
or may not be used in accordance with the methodology of the benchmark;


indicate the position of each function or body who may exercise discretion in
relation to each individual element of the benchmark determination process;



outline each step of the ex-post evaluation process for the use of discretion,
including a clear reference to the function or body that evaluates any exercise
of discretion and, where applicable, its role in the benchmark determination
process.

191. This set of elements should provide the public with a clear and comprehensive view on
the use of discretion during the determination of the benchmark. As already said, the
presence of discretion in the computation of the benchmark could potentially imply the
existence of conflict of interest and therefore could represent a source of manipulation of
the benchmark, increasing the vulnerability of the latter. For this reason, ESMA believes
that this set of precise information on discretion should be included in the benchmark
statement, so as to enhance the transparency of the benchmark vis-à-vis the general
public.
192. Points (c) and (d) of Article 27(1) of the BMR are covered by Article 1(4) of the RTS:
administrators are required to indicate the means by which users will be informed of a
change to or the cessation of the benchmark, with reference to the obligation stemming
from Article 28 of the BMR.
Disclosure on types of benchmarks
193. Articles 2 to 7 further specify the points included in Article 27(2) of the BMR and they
do so in relation to the different types of benchmarks.
194. For regulated data benchmarks, due to their nature and minor susceptibility to
manipulation, the content of the benchmark statement is limited to the addition in the
description of the input data of the sources of the input data used, and the sectoral
disciplines applying to such sources of input data.
195.

The draft RTS requires administrators of interest rate benchmarks to:


refer to the enhanced regulatory regime applicable to interest rate benchmarks
under Annex I to the BMR, and specify which increased oversight mechanisms
are in force for the benchmark; and



include, in relation to points (e) and (f) of Article 27(2) of the BMR, details on
applicable time limits, e.g. with respect to delays in the publication of the
benchmark or its re-determination, and provisions on notification of users of
such exceptional events or circumstances.

98

196. The latter requirement, included for interest rate benchmarks in Article 3(1)(c) of the
draft RTS, refers to additional information regarding procedures that might apply under
exceptional circumstances, and it is proposed also for critical benchmarks in Article 5(h) of
the draft RTS. This particular requirement reflects the paramount importance of critical
benchmarks but also the potential systemic effects of interest rate benchmarks in case of
manipulation or cessation of such benchmarks.
197.

For commodity benchmarks, administrators would have to:


indicate whether the benchmark falls under the regime of Title II of the BMR
(“Benchmark integrity and reliability”, Article 4 to 16 of the BMR) or of Annex II
(“Commodity benchmarks”)24;



include in the definitions of key terms a concise description of the criteria that
define the relevant underlying physical commodity;



with respect to the explanations that the administrator has to publish for each
benchmark calculation according to Annex II, paragraph (7)(a) and (b) of BMR,
indicate the source where such explanations may be found; outline, on an
aggregate level, the professional profiles of the contributors to the benchmark
and explain, where available, why the benchmark is predominantly based on
contributions of non-supervised entities.

198. The proposed requirements for interest rate and commodity benchmarks are in line with
the original content of the DP and mainly aim at informing the public about the specific
regulatory regime to which interest rate and commodity benchmark are subject under the
BMR.
199. Articles 5 to 7 of the draft RTS further specify the points included in Article 27(2) of the
BMR in relation to critical, significant and non-significant benchmarks, taking into account
the principle of proportionality. For critical benchmarks, apart from an indication of the
qualification of critical benchmark, the draft RTS proposes an enhanced set of information
due to the systemic relevance of the benchmark, broadly in line with what was proposed in
the DP.
200.

In particular, the benchmark statement should:

24

Title II applies where a commodity benchmark:
•
Is a regulated data benchmark (input data from electricity and natural gas exchange are considered regulated data), or
•
is based on submissions by contributors which are in majority supervised entities, or
•
is a critical benchmark and the underlying asset is gold, silver or platinum.
Annex II applies in substitution of Title II (with exception of Article 10 – Outsourcing) where a commodity benchmark is not a
regulated data benchmark and is based on submissions by contributors which are in majority non-supervised entities (unless it is
outside the scope of the BMR), including critical benchmarks whose underlying asset is not gold, silver or platinum (for critical
commodity benchmarks subject to Annex II, the requirements regarding mandatory contribution and colleges are not applicable).

99



refer to the enhanced regulatory regime applicable to critical benchmarks under the
BMR and specify which increased oversight mechanisms are in force for the
benchmark;



contain information, to the extent available, on the most relevant types of financial
instruments / contracts and investment funds that reference the critical benchmark;



contain information, to the extent available, on the degree of use of the benchmark
in one or more Member States and on the total reference value in respect of the
critical benchmark;



explain that the benchmark is subject to mandatory administration and mandatory
contribution and to supervision by a college of supervisors (including the national
competent authority (NCA) and ESMA);



where the benchmark is based on contributions, the statement should contain a list
of the contributors; contain a description, on an aggregate level, of major categories
of the contributors to the benchmark and where they are located;



in the event of a planned cessation, administrators of critical benchmarks should
provide details of how the users can contact the administrator or the NCA to provide
further information on the adverse impact on the user should the benchmark cease
to exist;



for the purpose of Article 27 (2)(e) and (f) of the BMR, the benchmark statement
should include details on applicable time limits, e.g. with respect to delays in the
publication of the benchmark or its re-determination, and provisions on notification
of users of such exceptional events or circumstances.

201. As a result of the above elements, the public, including persons with limited financial
knowledge, should be able to understand why the benchmark is considered critical and
what are its characteristics, degree of use and the implications of being classified as critical.
202. For all types of benchmarks, the single identifier of the benchmark should be included,
where available, as this is a relevant information for the public in order to easily identify a
benchmark and indisputably distinguish it from others. The ISIN code of the benchmark
should be used when available. Within the current international work stream on the “unique
product identifier”, IOSCO and CPMI are working on an underlier ID that could also be
included when it becomes available.
Update requirement
203. The empowerment received by ESMA in Article 27(3) of the BMR refers to further
specification of “the cases in which an update of such statement is required”, and Article 4
of the draft RTS covers this topic.

100

204. Article 8(1) states that administrators should review and update the benchmark
statement whenever the information it provides would no longer be considered correct or
sufficiently precise. Article 8(2) specifies in particular that an update of the statement is
needed in the following cases:


the benchmark is no longer reliable to accurately measure the underlying
market or economic reality;



a change in the type of the benchmark;



a significant change in the benchmark or in the methodology of its calculation;



when fair and easy access to information is impaired as a consequence of a
change in the information incorporated in the benchmark statement by
reference.

205. This list of circumstances should be understood as non-exhaustive, identifying specific
cases where the update is indispensable, but clearly administrators could be required to
update the statement in other cases too, as per Article 8(1) of the draft RTS.
Q21: Do you agree with the proposed specifications of the contents of a benchmark
statement?
Q22: Do you agree with the proposed specifications of the cases in which an update of
such statement is required? Do you have any further proposals? Please explain.

9.4 Draft technical standards: Benchmark statement

COMMISSION DELEGATED REGULATION (EU) No …/..
of XXX

supplementing Regulation (EU) No 2016/1011 of the European
Parliament and of the Council with regard to regulatory technical
standards for the benchmark statement to be published by
administrators of benchmarks

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EU) No 2016/1011 of the European Parliament and of the Council
of 8 June 2016 on indices used as benchmarks in financial instruments and financial contracts
or to measure the performance of investment funds and amending Directives 2008/48/EC and
2014/17/EU and Regulation (EU) No 596/201425, and in particular Article 27(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1)

In order to provide users of benchmarks with appropriate key information,
administrators of benchmarks should publish and keep updated clear and consise
benchmark statements. General rules with respect to the content of such benchmark
statements regarding transparency, appropriateness and user caution require further
specification. The more detailed requirements laid down under this Regulation are due
to apply to all types of benchmarks, according to Regulation No 2016/1011. A
proportional approach has been pursued, as appropriate and feasible, in order to
moderate the burden on administrators in connection with the completion of the
benchmark statements required to be drafted for all the benchmarks or families of
benchmarks provided.

(2)

Particular attention has to be paid to information on discretionary elements in the
benchmark’s calculation to ensure transparency, investor and consumer protection.

25

102

(3)

Different types of benchmarks (i.e. regulated-data benchmarks, interest rate
benchmarks, commodity benchmarks, critical benchmarks, significant benchmarks, and
non-significant benchmarks) can be subject to different requirements. It is important for
administrators and users of a benchmark to know which provisions apply to a particular
benchmark. Due to their potential systemic importance, information about critical
benchmarks might also be of interest and relevance to the general public. Furthermore,
disclosure requirements reflect differences between types of benchmarks to ease the
regulatory burden for benchmarks that have not been deemed to be critical benchmarks.

(4)

For all types of benchmarks, the benchmark statement should include, where available,
the benchmark’s single identifier, as this represents unique source of information for the
public in order to easily identify a benchmark and indisputably distinguish it from the
others.

(5)

Information on the type of a benchmark is required to determine which regime applies
to it under Regulation (EU) No 2016/1011. this should be reflected in the benchmark
statement. Additionally, where a benchmark exhibits the characteristics of two different
types of benchmarks (e.g. a commodity benchmark which is a regulated data
benchmark), all specific provisions set up in this Regulation apply in parallel to provide
the stakeholders with comprehensive information on the benchmark’s characteristics.

(6)

This Regulation is based on the draft regulatory technical standards submitted by the
European Securities and Markets Authority to the Commission.

(7)

The European Securities and Markets Authority has conducted open public
consultations on the draft regulatory technical standards on which this Regulation is
based, analysed the potential related costs and benefits and requested the opinion of the
Securities and Markets Stakeholder Group established by Article 37 of Regulation (EU)
No 1095/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council26,

HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:

take into account, inter alia, the following indicators, giving consideration to the
methodology used for the specific benchmark:
a) the minimum size of the measured market or economic reality; and, where
applicable, circumstances in which the administrator would lack sufficient input
data to determine the benchmark according to the methodology;
b) where relevant, the degree of liquidity of the underlying market required to
ensure the integrity and reliability of the benchmark determination according to
the methodology, describing the environment that generally allows executing a
transaction as a result of an active market having observable bona fide, armslength transactions and taking into account a variety of factors, such as size,
liquidity, market concentration and market dynamics;

10 Authorisation and registration of an administrator (Article
34 BMR)
10.1 Mandate
Article 34
[...]
8. ESMA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify further the information
to be provided in the application for authorisation and in the application for registration, taking
into account that authorisation and registration are distinct processes where authorisation
requires a more extensive assessment of the administrator's application, the principle of
proportionality, the nature of the supervised entities applying for registration under point (b) of
paragraph 1 and the costs to the applicants and competent authorities.
ESMA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 1 April
2017.

10.2 Background
206. ESMA sets out a proposed version of the RTS for an application for authorisation or
registration, where it describes the information required from an applicant administrator by
a competent authority. The purpose of the RTS is to set out what would be the information
which is appropriate and sufficient in order for a competent authority to make a decision as
to whether the applicant fulfils the requirements under the Regulation (EU) 2016/1011.
Article 34(4) of the Regulation stipulates that “the applicant shall provide all information
necessary to satisfy the competent authority that the applicant has established, at the time
of authorisation or registration, all the necessary arrangements to meet the requirements
laid down in this Regulation.”
207. Under the Regulation, the competent authority must deal with an application within an
applicable time limit – 4 months for an application for authorisation and 45 days for an
application for registration. To give the competent authority the ability to use the time
allowed for its examination effectively, all the requisite information must be provided to the
competent authority before the application can be considered complete in accordance with
Article 34(5).
208. The mandate expressly recognises that authorisation and registration are distinct
processes. The Regulation, in Article 34 (1), describes the circumstances in which an
applicant would initiate one or the other of those processes.

109

209. Authorisation is a more extensive process which is appropriate, as stipulated in the
Level 1, in relation to the importance of the benchmarks provided and whether the applicant
is not already supervised. The RTS, in its Annex I, sets out in detail the required information
for an authorisation application.
210. An application for registration would be a more streamlined process, which is
appropriate where the applicant is already known to the relevant competent authority as a
supervised entity (where the legal framework applicable to the entity does not prevent it
from acting as an administrator and only where it does not intend to act as administrator to
critical benchmarks), or in light of the importance of the benchmarks involved (i.e. nonsignificant benchmarks). Hence, in line also with the mandate, Annex II of the RTS sets
out the applicable requirements, by reducing the volume/granularity of information
required, as compared to an authorisation application. It should be noted that there is not
a single set of requirements applicable to all applications for registration; the requirements
vary depending on the particular circumstances entitling the applicant to initiate the
registration process. The requirements set out in Annex II to the RTS are tailored for the
following specific circumstances:


supervised entity providing one or more significant and non-significant benchmarks



supervised entity providing only non-significant benchmarks



non-supervised entity providing only non-significant benchmarks.

In the circumstance where a supervised entity provides a mix of significant and nonsignificant benchmarks, the elements of information concerning the providing entity and
the provision process remain the same, while those inherent to the particular benchmarks
provided are subject to a different degree of granularity of required information, depending
on the category to which the benchmarks belong to.

10.3 Analysis following feedback from stakeholders
211. ESMA’s view, consistent with the mandate, is that the RTS should take into account
the principle of proportionality, as well as the underlying costs to the applicants and
competent authorities. It also takes into account the objective of ensuring that the
requirements are appropriate for the diversity of profiles of benchmarks providers and the
benchmarks themselves.
212. Feedback from the Discussion Paper indicated that a duplication of information should
be avoided. ESMA agrees and the RTS provides that the information which would
otherwise be required need not be provided to the applicant if the relevant competent
authority would easily be in possession of it.
213. Also as a result of feedback to the DP, information can be provided at the level of
families of benchmarks, so long as they fall within the applicable definition in the
Regulation, and none of the benchmarks in the family is a critical benchmark.
110

214. It should be noted that authorisation and registration are adopted at the level of the
applicant administrator and would be a “one-off” process. If an applicant is authorised or
registered, then it would become subject to the Regulation and further developments, e.g.
where the applicant adds new benchmarks, would be dealt with in accordance with the
terms of the Regulation, e.g., Art 26(2) which requires an administrator to immediately
notify its competent authority when the administrator’s non-significant benchmark exceeds
the threshold and to comply with the requirements applicable to significant benchmarks
within three months. Along the same lines, if an administrator that originally underwent a
process of authorisation/registration and none of the benchmarks provided at that time
were critical, takes over the provision of a critical benchmark, or if any of the benchmarks
already provided hits any of the critical benchmarks relevant thresholds, that should be
regarded, in ESMA’s view, as a material change to be notified to the competent authority
in pursuance of Article 34(2) of the Regulation.
Q23: Do you agree with the general approach to distinguish the contents of the
application with reference to the cases of authorisation or registration?

10.4 General information/ financial information
215. ESMA considers it appropriate to require information of a general nature from all
applicants. This information would include basic information, such as name and address.
It would also cover more comprehensive details about the operations of the applicant, both
supervised and non-supervised in the European Economic Area, and its ownership, which
information may prove useful for a consideration of the appropriateness of an applicant’s
arrangements in different aspects, e.g. conflicts of interest.
216. Specific financial information is also listed. Where the applicant has existing operations,
the requirement may be satisfied by providing its existing financial statements. For an
applicant without such a financial history, a description of its plans would be required. For
an application for authorisation, but not registration, financial forecasts and plans to access
the financial markets over the following year would also be required. A supervised entity
needs to provide evidence of compliance with its applicable regulatory capital
requirements.
Q24: Are the general and financial information requirements described appropriate for
authorisation applications? Are the narrower requirements appropriate for registration
applications?

interest/internal control structure/oversight and accountability
frameworks
217. Information on organisation structure and governance will focus on how the business
is conducted and on the senior management of the applicant. The requirements would also
give the competent authority an indication of how the applicant has allocated its human
111

resources to the different parts of its business. All the organisational information
requirements apply to both authorisation and registration processes, taking into account
the need of a competent authority to have access to such information for its thorough
review of the application.
218. ESMA considers that information on conflicts of interest is particularly important. All
applicants should provide information regarding:
a) the policies and procedures which will cover conflicts of interest and how they are
handled, including a description of particular circumstances which apply to an applicant
in relation to which potential conflicts could most likely arise, and
b) how the remuneration policy is structured, particularly in relation to the calculation and
marketing of a benchmark.
219. The requirement in b) may be satisfied by providing the remuneration policy, in which
the criteria used to determine the remuneration of the persons involved directly or indirectly
in the activity of provision of benchmarks is specified. This document should therefore allow
the competent authority to assess that the remuneration of these persons does not depend
on the level of the benchmarks provided.
220. For critical benchmarks only, an inventory of conflicts, together with mitigating
measures, must be provided. This requirement was also suggested in the feedback to the
DP.
221. For the purpose of allowing the competent authority to evaluate the pertinence and
robustness of the internal control structure, and oversight and accountability frameworks,
an applicant should provide to the competent authority, in a sufficient level of detail, policies
and procedures for monitoring the activities of the provision of a benchmark or family of
benchmarks, including information on:
a) information technology systems
b) incident management policies
c) risk management policies
d) the appointment, substitution or removal of individuals within the key functions
e) the integrity and reliability of the benchmark’s determinations
f)

the internal reporting of infringements.

222. For an application for registration a requirement for abbreviated information on internal
control structure, as well as oversight and accountability frameworks would be required.

112

Q25: Are the requirements covering the information on the applicant’s internal
structure and functions appropriate?

10.6 Description of benchmarks provided
223. For the purposes of allowing the competent authority to assess each benchmark’s
representativeness of the economic reality it intends to measure, the applicant should
provide the competent authority with a description of each benchmark or family of
benchmarks provided or intended to be provided and the type and category to which the
applicant believes the benchmark belongs.
224. The category (critical, significant or non-significant) to which each benchmark belongs
to is to be assessed to the best of the knowledge of the applicant administrator and should
be provided along with an indication of the sources of data used.
225. ESMA, taking into account the comments from the DP, has recognised, in drafting the
RTS, that where information is or will be required from the applicant by the Regulation apart
from the application process, it can be provided by the applicant to satisfy both the
requirements for information in the application and the requirements otherwise in the
Regulation. To have the effect of reducing duplication, the relevant form – e.g. compliance
statement, benchmark statement or methodology – needs to be provided to the competent
authority as a part of a complete application under Article 34 (4)-(6).
226. If the applicant provides a compliance statement for its non-significant and/or significant
benchmarks, along with the rationales behind the application of any exemption, then the
information so provided does not have separately to be submitted to the competent
authority as part of the application process.
227. The application should also clearly state to which type each benchmark belongs to:
regulated-data benchmarks, interest-rate benchmarks or commodity benchmarks. ESMA’s
view is that there is no need to require specific additional information regarding the first
category, as information otherwise required should be sufficient.
228. Specific information should be provided for interest-rate benchmarks, allowing the
competent authority to assess whether the more stringent requirements set out in Annex I
of the Regulation covering the contribution process for such benchmarks are fulfilled.
229. As set out in Article 19 of the Regulation, in case (i) the commodity benchmark is
compiled from regulated data, or (ii) the majority of contributors to it are supervised entities,
or (iii) the benchmark is critical and the underlying is a precious metal, the general
requirements established in the Regulation will be applicable (under Title II). Otherwise,
the requirements set out in Annex II of the Regulation would be applicable. ESMA has
proposed that, apart from the addition of specific information for commodity benchmarks
set out in Annex II of the Regulation, no other change needs to be made to the
requirements for an application for a benchmark covered by the Annex.

113

230. ESMA is of the view that the information to be provided in the application should include
an explanation of how the applicant administrator will be satisfied that there is sufficient
input data to represent accurately and reliably the economic reality that the benchmark is
intended to measure. This information overlaps with the information required by a
benchmark statement; hence, as anticipated above, it may be submitted to the competent
authority in the form of a benchmark statement.
231. In addition, the information in the application should also include the list of the key
elements of a benchmark’s methodology the applicant intends to publish and the media
that will be used for publication of the benchmark’s determinations. The information is likely
to be covered by the methodology also required by the Regulation, Articles 12 and 13, and
the related RTS, because the requirements are similar. An applicant can submit the
methodology as a part of its application and then it would not need to duplicate the
information elsewhere in the application.
232. The information requirements for input data do vary depending on whether the
application is for authorisation or registration; for registration, there are more streamlined
requirements.
Q26: Are the requirements described dealing with the benchmarks provided
appropriate? In particular, is the way in which the commodity benchmarks requirements
are handled acceptable?

10.7 Other
233. ESMA considers that arrangements (if any) relating to outsourcing of any activity
forming a part of the process for the provision of a benchmark justifies a separate section
within the application. The arrangements involved may be important to an application and
should cover, e.g., the details about the service provider, the outsourced functions and
oversight of the outsourcing arrangements. But more streamlined requirements apply to
registration – in particular, the outsourcing contracts need not be provided.
234. Article 34(1) of the Regulation provides for the authorisation of a natural person (as well
as a legal person) located in the EU that intends to act as an administrator by a competent
authority. The RTS sets out specific requirements which are viewed as non-appropriate to
a natural person as applicant.
Q27: Is the specific treatment for a natural person as applicant appropriate?
235. The Regulation, in Article 34(4), allows the relevant competent authority to request
more information – even if it is not specifically described in the RTS – in order to satisfy the
competent authority that the applicant has established the necessary arrangements to
meet the Regulation’s requirements.
236. Similarly, the RTS contemplate that an applicant can provide more information to its
competent authority.
114

237. The form of the application for authorisation or registration to be submitted to the
relevant competent authority is not part of the draft RTS as it is not mentioned in the
mandate received by ESMA. However, ESMA considers that this is an important aspect
and believes that some guidance could be needed in relation to the practical submission
of the application for authorisation and registration to the relevant competent authority and
therefore ESMA stands ready to use its powers under Regulation (EU) No. 1095/2010 to
inform market participants in due time.
Q28: Do you agree with the proposals outlined for requirements for other information?

COMMISSION DELEGATED REGULATION (EU) No …/..
of XXX
[…]

supplementing Regulation (EU) No 2016/1011 of the European Parliament
and of the Council with regard to regulatory technical standards on the
information to be provided in the application for authorisation and in the
application for registration
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EU) No 2016/1011 of the European Parliament and of the Council
of 8 June 2016 on indices used as benchmarks in financial instruments and financial contracts
or to measure the performance of investment funds and amending Directives 2008/48/EC and
2014/17/EU and Regulation (EU) No 596/201427 and in particular Article 34(8) thereof,
Whereas:
(1)

This Regulation sets out the information that competent authorities should receive as
part of an application for authorisation or registration to act as administrator of
benchmarks, in order for a competent authority to assess whether the arrangements
established by the applicant at the time of the request for authorisation or registration
meet the requirements laid down in the Regulation No 2016/1011.

(2)

Certain information requested in this Regulation might not be applicable depending on
the characteristics of the applicant or of the benchmarks provided and intended for use
in the European Union.

(3)

In order for the competent authorities to assess that the applicant administrator has the
financial means to implement the policies and procedures laid down in the Regulation
No 2016/2011 and to exercise the activity of provision of benchmarks on an ongoing
basis and in compliance with the requirements the Regulation No 2016/2011, the
application shall cover financial information on the administrator, regarding mainly its
ownership structure, its financial statements and its financial forecasts.

(4)

In order for competent authorities to assess if any conflicts of interest arising from the
benchmark activity and business interests of the owners of an administrator might affect
the independence of an administrator in the benchmark calculation and thus impair the
accuracy and integrity of the benchmark, an administrator should be required to give

27

OJ L 171, 29.6.2016, p. 1.

116

information regarding the activities of its owners and the ownership of its parent
undertakings.
(5)

An applicant should provide information on the composition, functioning and
independence, in the benchmark calculation, of its governing bodies in order for
competent authorities to be able to assess whether the corporate governance structure
ensures the independence of the administrator in the benchmark calculation and the
avoidance of conflicts of interest and in addition an applicant should provide
information on its senior management.

(6)

An applicant administrator should give information on its policies and procedures about
the identification, management, mitigation and disclosure of conflicts of interests
regarding its activity of provision of benchmarks. For critical benchmarks, giving their
greater relevance, an applicant administrator should inform the competent authority with
an up-to-date inventory of existing conflicts of interest, along with an explanation on
how these are actually managed.

(7)

For the purposes of allowing the competent authority to evaluate the pertinence and
robustness of the internal control structure, oversight and accountability framework, an
applicant should provide the competent authority with the policies and procedures for
monitoring the activities of the provision of a benchmark or family of benchmarks. The
competent authority would therefore assess that these policies and procedures meet the
requirements of the Regulation.

(8)

Information should also be included in the application to demonstrate to the competent
authority that the controls on the input data on the basis of which are calculated the
benchmarks provided by applicant are adequate to ensure the representativeness,
accuracy and integrity of such data, and that the methodology applied for the calculation
of the benchmarks present all the characteristics required by the Regulation (EU) No
2016/1011.

(9)

For the purposes of allowing the competent authority to assess the benchmark’s
representativeness of the economic reality it intends to measure, the applicant should
provide the competent authority with a description of a benchmark or family of
benchmarks provided or is intended to be provided and the types and categories to which
they belong, in line with what is set out in the Regulation No 2016/1011. The type and
category to which the benchmark belongs to is to be assessed to the best of the
knowledge of the applicant administrator and should be provided along with an
indication of the sources of data used, so as to allow the competent authority to
understand the reliability and exhaustiveness of the underlying information.

(10)

This Regulation also specifically sets out the contents of an application for an
authorisation or registration where the applicant is a natural person .

(11)

This Regulation is based on the draft regulatory technical standards submitted by the
European Securities and Markets Authority to the Commission.

(12)

The European Securities and Markets Authority has conducted open public
consultations on the draft regulatory technical standards on which this Regulation is
based, analysed the potential related costs and benefits and requested the opinion of the

117

Securities Markets Stakeholder Group established in accordance with Article 37 of
Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council28].

11 Recognition of an administrator located in a third country
(Article 32 BMR)
11.1 Mandate
Article 32
[...]
5. An administrator located in a third country intending to obtain prior recognition as referred
to in paragraph 1 shall apply for recognition with the competent authority of its Member State
of reference. The applicant administrator shall provide all information necessary to satisfy the
competent authority that it has established, at the time of recognition, all the necessary
arrangements to meet the requirements referred to in paragraph 2 and shall provide the list of
its actual or prospective benchmarks which may be used in the Union and shall, where
applicable, indicate the competent authority responsible for its supervision in the third country.
Within 90 working days of receipt of the application referred to in the first subparagraph of this
paragraph, the competent authority shall verify that the conditions laid down in paragraphs 2,
3 and 4 are fulfilled.
[…]
9. ESMA may develop draft regulatory technical standards to determine the form and content
of the application referred to in paragraph 5 and, in particular, the presentation of the
information required in paragraph 6.
In the event that such draft regulatory technical standards are developed, ESMA shall submit
them to the Commission.
Power is conferred on the Commission to adopt the regulatory technical standards referred to
in the first subparagraph in accordance with the procedure laid down in Articles 10 to 14 of
Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.

11.2 Background
238. Third country benchmarks that are referenced in financial instruments, financial
contracts and investment funds in the European Union as of 1 January 2020 shall be
permitted for use by supervised entities only for such financial instruments, financial
contracts and investment funds (Article 51 of Regulation (EU) No 2016/1011) but not for
new ones.
239. If a third-country provider wants new financial instruments, financial contracts and
investment funds in the European Union to start to reference its benchmarks after the
above mentioned date, an equivalence decision adopted by the Commission according to
132

Article 30 of Regulation (EU) No 2016/1011 is necessary or the benchmarks need to be
endorsed by a European administrator or supervised entity, in line with what is laid down
by Article 33 of the mentioned Regulation, or the third-country provider is granted
recognition, as envisaged in Article 32 of the same Regulation.
240. With particular regard to the process of recognition of a third-country benchmarks
provider, a number of conditions are to be fulfilled and demonstrated in the context of the
application. First of all it is required that the third-country provider complies with the
requirements foreseen in the European Regulation for benchmarks, with the exclusion of
the provisions of the Regulation respectively dealing with the input data representativeness
of a benchmark’s underlying market or economic reality, imposing obligations on European
supervised contributors and addressing the peculiarities of European benchmarks
declared critical.
241. The Regulation additionally provides that a third-country entity applying for recognition
may alternatively fulfil the condition referred to above by demonstrating the compliance
with the IOSCO Principles for Financial benchmarks (FR07/13, July 2013) or the IOSCO
Principles for Price Reporting Agencies (FR06/12, 5 October 2012), as applicable, provided
that the application of such principles is equivalent to compliance with the requirements
established in the European Benchmarks Regulation.
242. Another condition for granting recognition is the establishment of a legal representative
of the third-country provider in the EU (Article 32(3)), which can be either a natural person
domiciled in the EU or a legal person with its registered office in the EU and has to perform
the oversight function, within the provision process of benchmarks, together with the
applicant third-country entity. The legal representative plays a key role as it shall act on
behalf of the third-country entity vis-à-vis the EU authorities and any other person in the
EU and shall be accountable to the competent authority of the Member State of reference.
243. There are some other essential conditions for the granting of recognition of a thirdcountry benchmarks provider, that are not under the remit of the latter: (i) where the
provider located in a third country is subject to supervision, the existence of a cooperation
arrangement between the competent authority of the Member State of reference and the
competent authority of the third country; (ii) the effective exercise by the competent
authority of the Member State of reference of the supervisory functions assigned by
Regulation (EU) No 2016/1011 is neither prevented by the laws, regulations or
administrative provisions of the third country where the provider is located, nor by
limitations in the supervisory and investigatory powers of that third country's supervisory
authority.
244. While there is no request to specify anything as concerns the latter two conditions,
ESMA may instead develop regulatory technical standards to specify the form and content
of an application for recognition (Article 32(9)) covering all of the above said conditions on
which the recognition is based. Notwithstanding the non-mandatory nature of the
empowerment, ESMA has elected to draft regulatory technical standards in this field, with
a view to ensure consistency of approach within the different Member States’ competent
133

authorities, which is particularly relevant given the third-country provider, once it is granted
recognition in one Member State, is entitled to passport for the provided benchmarks in the
whole Union territory. Furthermore, a common approach at EU level would provide for legal
certainty to potential third-country applicant providers.
245. The competent authority of the Member State of reference has 90 days to process the
request for recognition and adopt a decision. However, such period of time is suspended
for 30 days to allow ESMA to issue its advice on the eligibility of the benchmarks, declared
by the third-country entity in the request for recognition, for the application of the regime
set forth in the Regulation either for the significant benchmarks or for the non-significant
ones.
246. The appraisal of the opportunity to apply one or the other regime is mainly based on
the information provided by the applicant, which is due to be examined by both the
competent authority of the Member State of reference and ESMA. For this reason, the
empowerment in the Level 1 specify that in case ESMA decides for the development of
regulatory technical standards, these should also elaborate on the presentation of the
information supporting demonstration of the relevance of each benchmark provided and
intended for use in the Union (significant vs. non-significant).

11.3 Analysis following feedback from stakeholders
247. In the Discussion Paper published on 15 February 2016 (ESMA/2016/288), ESMA
preliminary identified the following essential elements of the application for the recognition
of a third-country provider:
a. all information necessary to assess that the applicant has established, at the time
of recognition, all the necessary arrangements to meet the relevant requirements
for the recognition referred to under Article 32(2);
b. the list of its actual or prospective benchmarks which may be used in the Union;
and
c. the competent authority responsible for the supervision of the administrator in the
third country, where applicable.
248. With particular reference to item (i), ESMA noted that Article 34(4) on Authorisation and
registration of an administrator uses a very similar wording in requiring the applicant EUbased provider to demonstrate to the competent authority the establishment, at the time of
authorisation or registration, of all the necessary arrangements to meet the requirements
laid down in the Regulation. Consistently, it was proposed to align, though with due
adaptations, the set of information to be provided in the application for
authorisation/registration with that of the application for recognition.
249. The above said approach was regarded by many of the respondents to the consultation
as appropriate and was therefore reflected in the draft of the technical standards. Some
134

other respondents suggested that demonstration of the compliance with IOSCO Principles
should be sufficient for the sake of recognition and the information to be included in the
application could be the presentation of an independent audit and local supervisor
attestation as suggested by the Level 1 text. This has been duly reflected in the draft RTS
but ensuring conformity to the Regulation: it has been explicitly mentioned the possibility
that part of the information to be provided at the time of an application for recognition may
be given by the applicant to the competent authority of the Member State of reference by
way of submitting, along with the application, the assessment by an independent external
auditor or, where applicable, the certification by the supervising competent authority of the
third country.
250. Respondents to the consultation additionally suggest to include, within the information
to be provided at the time of the application for recognition, the following elements: (a) the
Legal Entity Identifier of the third-country applicant, where available, (b) the identity and
the role of the legal representative established in the Member State of reference, as well
as details of its involvement in the performing of the oversight function over the thirdcountry benchmarks provision process.
251. Some other respondents highlighted the opportunity to provide additional clarity on the
way to apply the criteria of Article 32, paragraph 4, of Regulation (EU) No 2016/1011.
ESMA noted that this aspect is not covered by the mandate in paragraph 9 of the same
article. The issue may be re-considered at a later stage, when ESMA will examine possible
requests for guidance in connection with the application of the relevant provisions.

11.4 Proposal
252. Consistently with the approach followed in the draft RTS on the contents of the
application for authorisation or registration, the contents of the application should cover, in
addition to the general information on the providing entity, all information necessary to the
competent authority to come to an understanding on whether the required arrangements
for meeting the relevant requirements have been put in place.
253. However, in order not to make the process uselessly burdensome, it is recognised that
in the specific context of the recognition of a provider located in a third country, the
documents that should be produced and disclosed in the third country for the sake of
compliance with the relevant IOSCO Principles, may be submitted as part of the application
for recognition including a clear mention of the information needed for the assessment
performed by the competent authority of the Member State of reference.
254. It is worth mentioning that the draft RTS specifies that the application for recognition
should be redacted in one of the official languages of the Union and that the applicant’s
financial statements to be submitted (where available), should comply with the International
Financial Reporting Standards or with local Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.

135

Q29: Do you agree with the approach followed in the draft RTS as regards the
general information that a third-country applicant should provide to the competent
authority of the Member State of reference?
255. ESMA additionally considered that the receiving competent authority should also satisfy
itself that its jurisdiction is the Member State of reference on the basis of the application of
the criteria laid down in Article 32(4) of Regulation (EU) No 2016/1011. As a consequence,
it is considered of use that the applicant provides, as an essential element of the
application, the documented evidence for the choice of the Member State of reference in
accordance with the recalled paragraph 4 of Article 32.
256. The RTS currently cover also the information on the applicant LEI (where available)
and on the identity and role performed by the legal representative, along the suggestions
received by stakeholders.
Q30: Do you agree with the approach followed in the draft RTS as regards the
information that a third-country applicant should provide in order to explain how
it has chosen a specific Member State of reference and which are the identity and
role of the appointed legal representative in such State?

257. According to the Level 1: if, and to the extent that, an administrator is able to
demonstrate that a benchmark it provides is a regulated-data benchmark or a commodity
benchmark that is not based on submissions by contributors the majority of which are
supervised entities, the requirements applicable in the provision process of such
benchmarks are those laid down under Article 17 and Article 19 of Regulation (EU) No
2016/1011. Moreover, and as anticipated, benchmarks provided from a third-country may
be entitled to the exemptions respectively applicable to significant and non-significant
benchmarks. That premised, it is clear that a qualifying part of the application for
recognition is constituted by information on the benchmarks that the third-country provider
intends to offer in the Union territory, which is addressed, in the draft regulatory technical
standards, in a separate section under the Annex detailing the contents of the application
for recognition.
258. In this context, ESMA proposes that the applicant provides documented evidence of
the nature and the relevance of the benchmarks it would want to offer in the EU. With
particular reference to the information concerning the relevance of the benchmarks, the
draft RTS requires the applicant to follow, to the extent possible, the indications laid down
in the delegated act that the EU Commission is due to adopt pursuant to Article 20(6), to
specify how to assess the nominal amount of financial instruments other than derivatives,
the notional amount of derivatives and the net asset value of investment funds that make
reference to benchmark, including in the event of an indirect reference to any such
benchmark within a combination of benchmarks.
259. ESMA also acknowledges that benchmarks provided from a third country and not yet
used in the Union at the time of the application for recognition should be considered as
136

non-significant at that time, mindful that the granting of the regimes set forth in Articles 24,
25 and 26 of Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 also implies the duty of a third-country provider
to notify the competent authority of the Member State of reference when a benchmark falls
below or exceeds the threshold established in point (a) of Article 24(1) of the mentioned
Regulation.
260. In line with what already put forward in the DP, ESMA also confirms the opportunity to
request the applicant to indicate the provisions of the Regulation for which it believes it
should be exempted, along with an explanation, as detailed as possible, of the reasons
why it should be eligible for such exemptions.
261. ESMA also acknowledges that the applicant may have already drafted a compliance
statement in its third country of location or, on a preventive basis, for the sake of disclosure
according to Articles 25(7) and 26(3) of the benchmarks Regulation. In this context it is
thus envisaged the possibility that the above said information and rationales are provided
to the competent authority of the Member State of reference by submitting the compliance
statement together with the application. When a compliance statement is not available,
ESMA still considers useful that the information around the application of any exemption in
the provision of significant or non-significant benchmarks from a third country is provided
for in the format suggested in the implementing technical standards that ESMA is asked to
draft by Articles 25(8) and 26(5) of Regulation (EU) No 2016/1011. Stakeholders resulted
to be very much supportive, in reply to consultation on the DP, of the above described
approach.
Q31: Do you agree with the approach followed in the draft RTS as regards the
information that a third-country applicant should give around the benchmarks it
provides and that are already used or intended for use in the Union? In particular,
do you agree with the proposals regarding the information to be provided on the
types and the categories to which the benchmarks belong to?

262. Article 32(6) requires the competent authority of the Member State of reference to notify
ESMA with an assessment supporting the exemption, based on the information provided
by the administrator in the application for recognition. Once ESMA has received the
assessment, it will have one month to produce an advice to the competent authority about
the application of the exemptions from those specific requirements, with the final decision
however resting with the national competent authority.
263. It is possible to think of three different scenarios: (a) a third-country provider applies for
recognition with reference to all benchmarks already used in the Union; (b) it applies for
recognition with reference to all benchmarks not already used in the Union; (c) it applies
for recognition with reference to a mix of benchmarks respectively used and not yet used
in the Union. It is ESMA’s view that the relevance of a benchmark in terms of its degree of
use may be consistently appraised only in the case of benchmarks already used in the
Union and that the data and information to provide in the context of an application for
recognition should therefore make reference to financial instruments, financial contacts an
137

investment funds referencing to any particular third-country benchmark in the Union. As a
consequence, in the scenario (b) above, no data and information on the degree of use of
such benchmarks may be provided by the applicant. However, as the benchmarks, even if
already provided in the third-country, are not yet used in the Union, it should be considered
that these are non-significant, at Union level, at the time of the application, and hence the
applicant should indicate the exemptions it would want to benefit of and the rationales
behind.
264. Therefore, and for the sake of clarity, it is worth specifying that given the third-country
benchmarks will in all circumstances qualify for one or the other regime, the overall length
of the recognition process shall be considered of 120 days (4 months, like in the case of
the authorisation of a provider located within the Union).

COMMISSION DELEGATED REGULATION (EU) No …/..
of XXX
[…]

supplementing Regulation (EU) No 2016/1011 of the European Parliament
and of the Council with regard to regulatory technical standards on the
form and content of the application for recognition with the competent
authority of the Member State of reference
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EU) No 2016/1011 of the European Parliament and of the Council
of 8 June 2016 on indices used as benchmarks in financial instruments and financial contracts
or to measure the performance of investment funds and amending Directives 2008/48/EC and
2014/17/EU and Regulation (EU) No 596/201433 and in particular Article 32(9) thereof,
Whereas:
(1)

For the purposes of an application for recognition under Article 32 of Regulation (EU)
No 2016/1011, an applicant third-country provider should, in first instance, identify the
Member State of reference, in application of the criteria provided for in paragraph 4 of
the cited article and the competent authority designated for that Member State as
indicated in the list of the competent authorities published by ESMA in accordance with
Article 40 of the mentioned Regulation. For the purpose of allowing a competent
authority to verify whether a legal representative for the applicant is established in its
jusrisdiction and other conditions required under Article 32, paragraph 4, of Regulation
(EU) 2016/1011, which render the identification of a particular Member State of
reference appropriate, an applicant third-country provider should be able to submit data
corroborating the choice made and to provide evidence of the legal representative being
established and acting as required under Article 32, paragraph 3, of Regulation (EU)
2016/1011.

(2)

This Regulation sets out the information that a competent authority is to receive as part
of an application for recognition by a third-country provider, with a view to provide a
comprehensive representation of the arrangements, policies and procedures established
by the third-country provider in order to fulfil the applicable requirements set out in
Regulation (EU) No 2016/1011 or the corresponding IOSCO Principles respectively

33

OJ L 171, 29.6.2016, p. 1.

139

applicable for Financial Benchmarks (FR07/13, July 2013) or for Oil Price Reporting
Agencies (FR06/12, 5 October 2012). This Regulation also avoids useless duplication
of information which could make the process more burdensome for the applicant and
the competent authority. However, the information needed for the competent authority
of the Member State of reference to perform its assessment must be clearly identified in
the set of documents. Moreover, certain information requested in this Regulation might
not be applicable, depending on the characteristics of the applicant or of the benchmarks
provided and intended for use in the European Union.
(3)

Any information submitted to a competent authority should be provided in a durable
medium which enables its storage for future use. In order to facilitate the identification
of the information submitted by an applicant provider, all documents should be
identified by a reference number.

(4)

The competent authority should satisfy itself, as part of the process for granting
recognition to a third-country provider, that the Member State of reference has been
correctly identified, in connection with the criteria set out by Article 32(4) of Regulation
(EU) No 2016/1011 and that a legal representative of the third-country provider is
established in its jurisdiction and has the power to act as required by the mentioned
Regulation, based on the information to be submitted by the applicant provider.

(5)

In order for the competent authorities to assess that the applicant administrator has the
financial means to implement the policies and procedures laid down in the Regulation
No 2016/2011 and to exercise the activity of provision of benchmarks on an ongoing
basis and in compliance with the requirements the Regulation N0 2016/2011, the
application shall cover financial information on the administrator, regarding mainly its
ownership structure, its financial statements and its financial forecasts.

(6)

In order for a competent authority to assess if any conflicts of interest arising from the
benchmark activity and business interests of the owners of an applicant might affect the
independence of a provider in the benchmark calculation and thus impair the accuracy
and integrity of any benchmark to be used in the Union territory, a third-country
applicant should be required to give information regarding the activities of its owners
and the ownership of its parent undertakings.

(7)

An applicant should provide information on the composition, functioning and
independence, in the benchmark calculation, of its governing bodies in order for a
competent authority to be able to assess whether the corporate governance structure
ensures the independence of the provider in the benchmark calculation and the
avoidance of conflicts of interest and, in addition, an applicant should provide the
curriculum vitae, recent criminal record and self-declarations on the good repute of its
senior management.

(8)

For the purposes of assessing how conflicts of interest are eliminated or managed and
disclosed, an applicant should provide the competent authority with an explanation as
to how any resulting conflicts of interest are identified, recorded, managed, mitigated,
prevented and remedied.

(9)

For the purposes of allowing the competent authority to evaluate the pertinence and
robustness of the internal control structure, oversight and accountability framework, an

140

applicant should provide the competent authority with the policies and procedures for
monitoring the activities of the provision of a benchmark or family of benchmarks.
(10)

Information should also be included in the application to demonstrate to the relevant
competent authority that the controls on the input data on the basis of which are
calculated the benchmarks provided by the third-country applicant, that are used or
intended to be used within the Union, are adequate to ensure the representativeness,
accuracy and integrity of such data, and that the methodology applied for the calculation
of the benchmarks present all the characteristics required by the Regulation (EU) No
2016/1011.

(11)

At the time a process for the recognition of a provider located in a third country is
initiated, some of the benchmarks it provides might already be used in the Union as a
reference in financial instruments, financial contracts or for measuring the performance
of investment funds and may continue to be used only in such financial instruments,
financial contracts and investment funds, if the use started prior to 1 January 2020, as
required by Article 51, paragraph 5, of Regulation (EU) 2016/1011. Some other
benchmarks it provides might not be used yet, but could be used in the Union after the
provider acquires the recognition. It could also be possible that an applicant has no
benchmarks already used in the Union or that it applies only for granting the continued
use, also in new financial instruments or financial contracts or investment funds, of all
benchmarks that are already used in the Union at the time of application. For the purpose
of allowing the competent authority to evaluate whether the benchmarks provided by
the applicant are suitable for their continued or prospective use in the Union, and with
the final objective of their inclusion in the register of Article 36 of Regulation (EU)
2016/1011, a list and description of benchmarks already used in the Union or intended
for (future) use in the Union needs to be provided along with the application for
recognition with the competent authority of the Member State of reference.

(12)

Information on the nature and characteristics of the benchmarks provided by the thirdcountry applicant, as well as of the underlying market or economic reality of the
benchmarks, would prove relevant in the context of demonstrating to the competent
authority of the Member State of reference whether the assessment of compliance with
the requirements of Article 32(2) of Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 is to be conducted with
reference to the special regimes applicable respectively to regulated-data benchmarks
and to commodity benchmarks not based on submissions by contributors the majority
of which are supervised entities, as set out in Regulation (EU) 2016/1011.

(13)

Information on the reference values of the benchmarks provided by the third-country
applicant would prove useful for the competent authority of the Member State of
reference to conduct a preliminary assessment of the opportunity to categorise any of
the benchmarks provided by the third-country applicant that are already used in the
Union, as either significant or non-significant, with the consequent possibility of
application of the respective exemptions, as set out in Regulation (EU) 2016/1011. On
the contrary, such information is not relevant in connection with those benchmarks that
are not already used in financial instruments, financial contracts and investment funds
in the Union, but that are described in the application for their inclusion under the
register of Article 36 of Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 for reason of their prospective use
in the Union. The latter should rather be considered as non-significant at the time of the
application for recognition.
141

(14)

The type and category to which the provided benchmarks or families of benchmarks
belong to is to be assessed to the best of the knowledge of the applicant and should be
provided along with an indication of the sources of data used.

(15)

This Regulation is based on the draft regulatory technical standards submitted by the
European Securities and Markets Authority to the Commission.

(16)

The European Securities and Markets Authority has conducted open public
consultations on the draft regulatory technical standards on which this Regulation is
based, analysed the potential related costs and benefits and requested the opinion of the
Securities Markets Stakeholder Group established in accordance with Article 37 of
Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council34.

12.2 Annex II – Preliminary high-level Cost Benefit Analysis
Section 1: Draft regulatory technical standards for the procedures and characteristics
of the oversight function
ESMA is mandated by Article 5(5) to develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify
the procedures regarding the oversight function and the characteristics of the oversight
function including its composition, along with its positioning within the organisational structure
of the administrator, so as to ensure the integrity of the benchmark and the absence of conflicts
of interest. ESMA proposes certain requirements for oversight functions, with a non-exhaustive
list of optional structures. Regarding the positioning, ESMA establishes the relationship
between the oversight function and the management body of the administrator, as well as the
instances in which the oversight function could be expected to act independently of the
administrator. The procedures proposed are the minimum expected, allowing for
proportionality depending on the size and nature of the benchmark.
Qualitative description
Benefits

The main benefit of the proposed draft regulatory technical standards is
to further specify key aspect of the oversight function, such as its
functioning, its positioning in the administrator’s organization and its
composition. In this way the draft standards expand the general
procedures and characteristics of the oversight function so as to provide
administrators with practical indication on how to implement Article 5 of
the BMR in their organisations.
Administrators would be the market participants who will benefit most
from the proposed draft regulatory technical standards. Also investors
and consumers would benefit from the draft standards, because of the
standards’ focus on conflict of interest and hence the enhanced integrity
of a benchmark provided under the scrutiny of an appropriate oversight
function that is established in conformity with the draft standards.
In general, the proposed standards have the advantage to further define
the content of Article 5 of the BMR while, at the same time, leaving
administrators with a balanced level of flexibility so as to adapt the
oversight function to their idiosyncratic situation. The requirements
included in the draft standards are non-exhaustive in the case of
composition and the minimum expected with regards to the procedures
of the oversight function, and administrator will be able to adjust them to
their size and the nature of the benchmark(s) they provide.
As requested by the empowerment received by ESMA, Article 1 of the
draft standards include a non-exhaustive list of governance arrangement
of the oversight function, composed by six types of arrangements.
Although the list is non-exhaustive, it should represent a very useful tool
154

for administrators in order to define the structure of their oversight
function appropriate to their benchmarks. The elements included in the
list represent different organizational solution to which most of the
administrators should be able to relate their own specific situation. That
is why administrators should be able to gain direct benefit from the
implementation of the proposed draft standards. Without the nonexhaustive list of appropriate governance requirements there is a risk
that administrators would apply Article 5 of the BMR in significantly
diverging ways.
In particular, the list defines a spectrum of possible structures of
oversight functions that goes from a basic form, in which the oversight
function is composed by a single natural person, to a structured form
where a function is composed of multiple committees performing a
subset of the oversight tasks. Administrators of multiple critical
benchmarks will be able to decide whether each critical benchmark
would need a separate committee or not operating within the overall
structure of the oversight function.
Investors and consumers should also benefit from the proposed draft
standards, because thanks to them each administrator should be able to
establish an appropriate oversight function, with positive effect in terms
of integrity of the benchmarks and therefore with direct benefit for the
ultimate users. In this context, the possibility of having independent
members, external stakeholders, and also observers in the oversight
function should improve even further the effectiveness of the oversight
function and the quality of its actions.
Costs

Potential additional costs will be borne by administrators only.
Depending on the structure of the oversight function chosen by the
administrator, cost will vary. An independent oversight committee or an
oversight function consisting of multiple committees possibly represent
the costliest form of oversight function, as opposed to the oversight
function composed by a single natural person. The proposed draft
standards allow administrators to embed the oversight function within
their organization rather than create an external committee: this flexibility
should substantially minimise costs for administrators.
Potential larger costs would be borne by administrators of critical
benchmarks or regulated data benchmarks with a “reference” value
above EUR 500 bn, as the proposed standards clarify that for them the
simplest form of oversight function, composed by a single natural
person, is not a viable organizational form (see Article 1(1) of the draft
standards).

155

Specific costs for administrators could arise from Article 3 of the
proposed draft standards “Procedures governing the oversight function”.
The Article is the specification of paragraph 2 of Article 5 of the BMR. In
the text of level 1, administrators are requested to develop and maintain
robust procedures regarding their oversight function, and Article 3 of the
proposed standards identifies some thirteen elements to be included in
the administrator’s procedures for oversight function. In particular, those
relating to disclosure, and the ones requiring the administrator to create
new policies could be considered a source of new costs.
Finally, another source of cost could be represented by the requirement
to record decisions and to notify the management body (see Article 2(3)
and (4) of the proposed draft standards).

156

Section 2: Draft regulatory technical standards on input data
ESMA is mandated by Article 11(5) of the Regulation EU 2016/1011 to specify further how to
ensure that input data is appropriate and verifiable as well as the internal oversight and
verification procedures of a contributor that the administrator has to ensure are in place where
the input data is contributed from a front office function. ESMA proposes, in its draft technical
standards, organisational and procedural requirements that the administrator must fulfil to
ensure what required by the level 1 provisions.
Qualitative description
Benefits

The proposed approach for ensuring appropriateness and
verifiability of input data contributed as well as ensuring the
internal oversight and verification procedures within a contributor
would promote a common and consistent control framework
across different administrators of benchmarks to the benefit of
users.
The evaluation and validation of input data aim at strengthening
the reliability of the benchmark through ensuring the integrity and
accuracy of the input data and reducing the opportunity to its
manipulation.
Furthermore, the internal oversight and verification procedures
where input data are contributed from a front office function
would allow to mitigate the specific risk of conflicts of interest that
arises in this particular case, and to reduce the opportunity to
manipulate data by implementing a robust internal oversight at
the contributor level.

Costs

Potential costs arising from these draft technical standards will
be borne by administrators and contributors of critical and
significant benchmarks.
The incremental costs stemming from the proposed approach in
relation to input data are not expected to be significant. Indeed,
the draft regulatory technical standards specify further the
requirements already included in the Regulation (EU) 2016/1011
regarding the appropriateness and verifiability of input data and
the internal oversight and verification procedures of contributors.
Moreover, the draft technical standards have been designed in
a way to minimise the burden on administrators, in accordance
with the principle of proportionality which is a general
requirement under Regulation (EU) 2016/1011. Where possible,
the requirements in these draft technical standards have been
157

reduced depending on the category of the benchmark and the
size of the contributor. For example, the internal oversight is
allowed to be aligned to pre-existing internal oversight structures
and may be simplified depending on the size of the contributor.

158

Section 3: Draft regulatory technical standards on transparency of methodology
ESMA is mandated by Article 13(3) of Regulation EU 2016/1011 to specify further the
information to be provided by an administrator in compliance with the requirements in relation
to the transparency of the methodology of the benchmark. ESMA proposes in its draft RTS a
minimum list of key elements to be disclosed by the administrator of the benchmark.
Furthermore, ESMA is specifying the procedure for internal review and approval of the
methodology and also the one to apply in case of material changes to the methodology of the
benchmark.
Qualitative description
Benefits

The proposed minimum list of key elements to be disclosed by
administrators of benchmarks would promote common and
consistent
transparency
principles
across
different
administrators of benchmarks, to the principal benefit of users.
This could turn out to prove beneficial also for administrators, as
it has the potential to create a fairer competitive environment.
The key elements of the methodology would be available to all
markets participants who would have access to the minimum list
of information required regarding all benchmarks and thus
achieve a global and complete view on the possibilities of
investments available in the market.
As the procedure for internal review of the methodology is aimed
at allowing administrators to ensure the continuous accuracy and
representativeness of a benchmark, a common approach for the
internal review of the methodology of benchmarks would
facilitate national competent authorities’ checks in relation to the
function that conducts the internal review, which is independent
from the one that has developed the methodology, and to the
correct management of conflicts of interest. This would also give
comfort to market participants regarding the reliability of the
benchmark concerned and would help to ensure investors
protection in the EU.
Finally, the specific procedure to be applied in the case of a
material change to the benchmark’s methodology would ensure
a common approach by all administrators of benchmarks that
would consult market participants and in particular users of
benchmarks before imposing any material change. This
consultation would allow users to comment on these material
changes and express any concern that they might have, thus
contributing to increasing investors protection.

159

Costs

Potential costs arising from these draft RTS will be borne by
administrators of critical and significant benchmarks.
The incremental costs stemming from the proposed
transparency of the methodology are not expected to be
significant. Indeed, the draft RTS specify further the
requirements already included in Regulation (EU) 2016/1011
regarding the publication of key elements of the methodology,
reviewing the methodology and having a specific procedure for
any material change to the methodology.
Moreover, as known, most of the already established indices
providers are already familiar with providing transparency of the
methodology applied.
Additionally, the draft RTS have been designed in a way to
minimise the administrative burden of administrators, in
accordance with the principle of proportionality which is a
general requirement under Regulation (EU) 2016/1011. Only the
necessary information to be disclosed has been included in
these draft RTS. Furthermore, where the approach depends on
the characteristics of the benchmarks and the discretion of the
administrators is needed the draft RTS do not impose any
additional requirement.

160

Section 4: Draft regulatory technical standards on elements to be included in the code
of conduct
ESMA is mandated by Article 15(6) of the Regulation to develop draft regulatory technical
standards to further specify the elements of the code of conduct referred to in paragraph 2 of
Article 15. For each criterion of Article 15(2), ESMA in its draft technical standards proposes
more detailed aspects to it.
Qualitative description
Benefits

The code of conduct sets out the expectations that the administrator
has for the behaviour of the contributors, so it is essential for
maintaining integrity of the benchmark. In particular, the provisions of
the code of conduct are designed to ensure that the right people are
acting to be submitters to the benchmark, that those persons who are
not permitted to do so do not submit input data to the benchmark and
that minimum standards of behaviour are implemented and maintained
within the business that contribute to the benchmark. Therefore these
provisions are beneficial to the integrity and robustness of the
benchmark which is beneficial to users and consumers as well as the
administrator and contributor.
Competent authorities would also benefit from the application of the
proposed technical standards as they include the reporting of actual
and suspected infringements to the administrator’s competent
authority and because the provisions in the code help distinguishing
the responsibilities of the administrator and of contributors within the
provision process. This will aid them in their duties where they
supervise the contributors.

Costs

Responses to the discussion paper have highlighted the issue that as
contribution to a benchmark is voluntary, should the provisions in the
articles of the RTS be too onerous and costly to the contributors, the
contributors may stop contributing to the benchmark which would be
damaging to the robustness of the benchmark.
Taking into consideration those concerns, ESMA has sought to not add
unnecessary requirements to contributors whilst maintaining rules that
mandate a high standard of integrity for all contributors to benchmarks.

161

Section 5: Draft regulatory technical standards on governance and control
requirements for supervised contributors
ESMA is mandated by Article 16(5) of the Benchmarks Regulation to specify further the
requirements applying to supervised contributors concerning governance, systems and
controls, and policies set out in paragraphs 1-3 of the same Article. ESMA in its draft technical
standards proposes more detailed aspects to further clarify the requirements, including in
relation to submitters of input data, and use of expert judgement.
Qualitative description
Benefits

There will be benefits from the further specification of the
requirements on supervised contributors both for supervised
contributors, and for the administrators to which the contributors
provide input data.
The main benefit of the further level of specification of the
requirements will be to ensure consistent application of the
requirements throughout the Union. Without such further
clarification, each supervised contributor would have to make its
own judgement of the way in which it should comply with the high
level requirements in the Benchmarks Regulation.
Different interpretation of the requirements by different
supervised contributors within a Member State would mean that
each national competent authority would have to establish for
itself criteria for judging compliance of contributors it supervised
with the requirements. Even if each national competent authority
established consistent application, a benchmark administrator
could find that its contributors in different Member States were
working to different standards.

Costs

In the absence of these technical standards, It is possible that
some supervised contributors would interpret the requirements
of Article 16 of the Benchmarks Regulation in a very limited way
so as to minimise their costs. By specifying the requirements in
more detail, these technical standards could add to the costs for
such contributors.
Some of the responses to the Discussion Paper identified areas
where extra costs could arise based on the proposals in that,
though without quantification. These were:


Operational requirements and IT investment

162



Monitoring, supervision, record-keeping



Staff training, external auditors

Some pointed out that increased costs for contributors could lead
to their withdrawal which in turn would lead to a reduction in the
number and quality of benchmarks to the detriment of
consumers.
ESMA has therefore sought to keep the specification to the
minimum needed to meet the objectives of the Benchmarks
Regulation. It has built in flexibility, for example on the rules on
sign-off. And it has where appropriate limited rules so that they
apply only to supervised contributors to critical benchmarks.
Through this Consultation Paper, ESMA is seeking further input
from stakeholders on taking into account the different
characteristics of benchmarks and supervised contributors, so
as to be able to further reduce costs.

163

Section 6: Draft regulatory technical standards on criteria to be assessed by competent
authorities when deciding to apply certain provisions to significant benchmarks
ESMA is mandated by Article 25(9) of the Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 to specify further nine
criteria referred to in paragraph 3 of the same Article. Competent authorities should take into
account these criteria when they assess whether it is appropriate to require an administrator
of a significant benchmark to apply one or more of the provisions listed in Article 25(1) of the
Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 although the administrator has chosen not to. For each criterion of
Article 25(3), ESMA in its draft regulatory technical standards (RTS) proposes more detailed
aspects to further clarify it and to give guidance for its assessments.
Qualitative description
Benefits

Both administrators of significant benchmarks and national
competent authorities would benefit from the application of the
proposed RTS.
The draft RTS contain a set of aspects to be taken into account
by competent authorities: the application of these elements by
competent authorities in their assessment would ensure that
Article 25(3) of the Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 is applied
consistently throughout the Union. Without such further
clarification, competent authorities would have to base their
assessment on the broader nine criteria alone. These criteria are
very general in nature, and different competent authorities would
possibly apply them differently in practice. Through the further
specification of the nine criteria in the draft RTS, the competent
authorities will have a pre-defined detailed framework based on
which they can develop their assessment more easily and more
rapidly, as they will not need to further specify the criteria of Level
1 by themselves.
Also administrators of significant benchmarks would indirectly
benefit from the application of RTS, as they provide
administrators (and the public in general) with a better
understanding of the elements on which a competent authority
will ground its assessment. This, in turn, could help
administrators of significant benchmarks to prepare a sound
notification to the competent authority, including all the relevant
information, to have their own assessment confirmed.
An additional benefit is a fairer competition among administrators
located in different Member States through increased
consistency of the approaches followed by competent
authorities.

Costs

The draft RTS concern activities to be performed by competent
authorities only, so they would not create additional costs for
administrators of significant benchmarks or market participants.
The information required under Article 25(3) of the Regulation
(EU) 2016/1011 is only intended to corroborate the
administrator’s assessment and hence should not have to cover
all criteria and the elements specified in these draft regulatory
technical standards, so no additional burden or cost for
administrators will result therefrom.
From the perspective of a competent authority, the incremental
costs stemming from the proposed set of elements are not
material. The Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 requires competent
authorities to prepare an assessment under Article 25(3). The
draft RTS merely further specify the nine criteria already included
in that provision.

Section 7: Draft implementing technical standards on compliance statement for
administrators of significant and non-significant benchmarks
ESMA is mandated by Article 25(8) to develop a template for the compliance statement that
administrators of significant benchmarks have to publish if they decide not to apply any of
the requirements listed in Article 25(1). Similarly, ESMA is mandated by Article 26(5) to
develop a template for the compliance statement that administrators of non-significant
benchmarks have to publish and provide to the relevant NCA if they decide not to apply any
of the requirements listed in Article 26(1). ESMA is proposing a template aiming at providing
a detailed explanation regarding the decision of not applying some BMR requirements,
while limiting the administrative effort that administrators will bear when developing and
updating their compliance statement.
Qualitative description
Benefits

The main benefit in proposing, through the draft ITS, a common
template for compliance statement to be used by administrators
is to increase the clarity of the document published, the
transparency of the reasons why the administrators have not
applied some requirements of the BMR and comparability of
compliance statements over different administrators/
benchmarks.
In relation to clarity, the use of a common template will facilitate
the analysis of the compliance statements by NCAs as well as
by users and other interested parties, and will enhance the
comparability of information among different significant
benchmarks with the objective of choosing the most appropriate
one for the intended use.
In addition, without a common template, administrators would
be left with no guidance on how to publish the information about
the decision of not applying some BMR requirements, in line
with Articles 25(1) and 26(1). Under this scenario, each
administrator would draft its own template which would entail the
risk of omitting necessary information. Moreover, under the
situation in which each administrator uses its own template,
comparison between compliance statements of different
administrators would be more difficult, as it is not sure that the
same types of information are included by different
administrators that are not required to use the same template.
All these issues are solved by the use of a common compliance
statement as the one proposed by ESMA.
In relation to transparency, it is important that a compliance
statement provides the public and NCAs with a comprehensible
166

and exhaustive motivation of the appropriateness of not
applying the provisions referred to in the compliance statement.
This can be achieved by an organisation of the content of the
statement that is clear and unambiguous. For this reason, the
template proposed by ESMA is organised into sections that are
internally divided into specific items. In particular, using the
proposed template, three crucial factors would be immediately
clear to the reader: (i) which requirements have been not
applied by the administrator; (ii) in the provision of which
benchmarks the requirements have not been applied;(iii) what
are the exact reasons why the decision was taken by the
administrator. Without a template to be used by administrators,
there would be the risk that each administrator applies the
provisions in the BMR differently, including different information
in the compliance statement and / or organising it differently.
Costs

Potential additional costs will be borne by administrators of
significant and non-significant benchmarks only.
The incremental costs stemming from the proposed template for
the compliance statement are minimal, if any. Indeed, it is the
Benchmarks Regulation requiring the publication of a
compliance statement. The draft ITS just provide a template for
such publication. Moreover, the template has been designed in
a way to minimise the administrative burden of administrators,
in accordance with the general requirement under Regulation
(EU) …/2016. The modular approach embedded in the template
ensures the administrative work needed to draft the template will
be limited to only strictly necessary information. In this context,
it should be noted that duplications within the proposed template
are completely avoided.

167

Section 8: Draft regulatory technical standards on the benchmark statement
ESMA is mandated by Article 27(3) of the BMR to specify further the contents of a benchmark
statement and the cases in which an update of such statement is required. ESMA proposes to
specify the items included in Article 27(1) and (2) through the definition of more specific
requirements, in terms of information to be included in the benchmarks statement, and criteria
to be considered by the administrators when preparing the statement. The proposed draft RTS
also differentiates the applicable requirements in terms of types of benchmarks.
Qualitative description
Benefits

The main benefit of proposing, through the regulatory technical
standards (RTS), a further specification of the content of the
benchmark statement to be published by administrators is to
increase the clarity of the document published, and comparability
of benchmarks statements produced by different administrators.
Users of benchmarks and consumers will be the category of
market participants who will benefit the most from the application
of the draft RTS, but also administrators, required to publish the
statement, will benefit as well.
As Recital 43 explains, the goal of the benchmarks statement is
to provide users of benchmarks with information in relation to
what a given benchmark intends to measure and its susceptibility
to manipulation, so that they can understand the risk profiles of
different benchmarks and choose appropriately among them.
Thanks to the requirements included in the RTS, the benchmark
statements of different administrators will include the same types
of information, making the comparability of the statement much
easier. In particular, benchmark statements will have to provide
a set of information in relation to any form of discretion in
calculation of a benchmark. This information on discretionary
elements of the benchmark’s calculation is key to ensure
transparency and investor/consumer protection because the
susceptibility of the benchmarks to manipulation much depends
on the level of discretion embedded in its calculation.
Administrators should benefit as well from the RTS. Indeed,
thanks to the RTS, the application of Article 27 of the
Benchmarks Regulation should be easier for them, as it leaves
less room for “wrong application” of the requirements they have
to apply under Article 27.

168

Costs

Potential additional costs will be borne by administrators of
benchmarks.
The incremental costs stemming from the proposed RTS for the
benchmark statement are considered minimal. Indeed, it is the
BMR requiring the publication of a benchmark statement, and
Article 27 of the Regulation already includes the main elements
that the administrator has to publish as part of the statement. It
is the obligation in Article 27 that is the main source of cost for
administrators (i.e. the original obligation to publish a benchmark
statement with a pre-defined content). The RTS per se does not
include additional elements in the benchmark statement, but
rather specifies how the elements in Article 27 must be
incorporated in practice in the published benchmark statement.
As the draft RTS takes into account the principle of
proportionality and distinguishes different types of benchmarks,
incremental costs are likely to be higher for administrators of
interest rate benchmarks and commodity benchmarks, and
administrators of critical benchmarks.

Section 9: Draft regulatory technical standards on the information to be provided in the
application for authorisation and in the application for registration
ESMA is mandated in accordance with Article 34(8) of the Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 to
specify further the information to be provided in the application for authorisation and in the
application for registration. ESMA proposes in its draft technical standards the set of
documents, data and information that the applicants located in the Union and that intend to act
as administrators should include in their application for authorisation and in their application
for registration.
Qualitative description
Benefits

The draft regulatory technical standards specify the set of
information to be submitted in the application for authorisation
and in the application for registration to the competent authority
of the Member State in which the administrator is located to
demonstrate compliance with the requirements of Regulation
(EU) No 2016/1011. This specification of all information to be
provided in the application for authorisation and in the application
for registration would promote a common and consistent process
throughout the Union.
These Technical Standards would benefit competent authorities
in the different Member States who will have a pre-defined and
common framework to conduct their assessment in accordance
with Article 34(8) of the Regulation (EU) No 2016/1011. This
assessment will not be based solely on the provisions of the
mentioned article of the Regulation, which do not include the
specific information to be provided for an applicant to be
authorised or registered. Without this further clarification, each
competent authority would define different requirements to be
satisfied by applicants.
In close connection, applicant entities would also benefit from
these technical standards as they will know in advance which is
the information to be submitted in order to obtain authorisation
or registration.
Finally, the specification of common and consistent information
to be provided for authorisation or registration purposes would
also increase investor protection as the final investors would be
ensured that the benchmarks provided by an authorised or
registered administrator throughout the Union have applied the
same process and provided the same information for
assessment by competent authorities.

170

Costs

The draft technical standards specify further the requirements
already included in the Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 regarding the
information to be provided in the application for authorisation and
in the application for registration. Therefore, additional costs
stemming from the application of the proposed technical
standards are not expected to be material.
Moreover, in drafting these technical standards ESMA tried to
minimise the burden on administrators, in accordance with the
principle of proportionality which is a general requirement under
the Regulation (EU) 2016/1011. Where possible, the
requirements in these draft technical standards have been
reduced depending on the category and type of the benchmark.
For example, for critical benchmarks an inventory of actual and
potential conflict of interests is to be included in the
corresponding policies and procedures while for significant and
non-significant benchmarks only the conflicts of interests which
could most likely arise would be included.
Furthermore, these technical standards reduce also the burden
on administrators by not requiring the duplicative submission of
information to the competent authority when it is contained in
other documents which are also due to be provided to the
competent authority as result of the application of other parts of
Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 (i.e. the benchmark statement, the
methodology, the compliance statement). This non-duplication of
the information provided in the application file aims at avoiding
any additional costs for administrators.

171

Section 10: Draft regulatory technical standards on the form and content of the
application for recognition of a third-country benchmarks provider
ESMA may, in accordance with Article 32(9) of the Regulation (EU) 2016/1011, specify the
form and content of the application of a third-country provider to obtain recognition as
envisaged in the mentioned Article 32. ESMA has decided to draft the regulatory technical
standards in this context. Applicants from third countries should therefore conform to the
requirements further developed by ESMA in this context.
Qualitative description
Benefits

The draft regulatory technical standards specify the set of
documents, data and information to be submitted to the
competent authority of the Member State of reference to
demonstrate compliance with the requirements of Regulation
(EU) No 2016/1011 or with the applicable IOSCO Principles, the
nature and relevance of the benchmarks intended for offer in the
Union territory, details of the legal representative established in
the Member State of reference and the criteria applied to
determine the Member State of reference.
The specification of all pieces of information to be provided in the
application for recognition would ensure that the process
envisaged by Article 32 of the Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 is
undertaken consistently throughout the Union. Without such
further clarification, competent authorities in the different
Member States will have to individually set the form and content
of an application for recognition, based on the solely Level 1
provisions. As a consequence of the adoption of the regulatory
technical standards, competent authorities will instead have a
pre-defined detailed framework, based on which they can
conduct their assessments, as required by Article 32,
paragraphs 5 and 6, more easily and more rapidly and with less
uncertainty about comprehensiveness of received information.
Also third-country providers would benefit from the application of
the draft technical standards as they will know in advance which
are the documents, data and information to be submitted in order
to obtain the recognition, irrespective of the Member State of
reference and thus with no incentive to forum shopping.
An additional indirect benefit is connected with the enhanced
protection offered to final investors and consumers, as the
benchmarks provided in third-countries by a recognised

172

administrator will be all scrutinised on the basis of a consistent
set of information.
Costs

The draft regulatory technical standards is aimed at detailing the
contents of an application for recognition, on the basis of the
requirements already provided for in the Level 1, but with a view
to standardisation of an application contents. As the required
information should nevertheless be provided, in order for the
applicant to be granted the recognition in accordance with Article
32 of the Regulation (EU) 2016/1011, no additional burden or
costs for administrators are foreseeable as a direct result of the
application of these draft regulatory technical standards.
From the perspective of EU competent authorities, there are no
foreseeable incremental costs stemming from the application of
the draft regulatory technical standards, as the latter would
nonetheless be required to conduct the assessments, as
required by Article 32, paragraphs 5 and 6, of the Regulation
(EU) No 2016/1011, after the request of applicant third-country
providers.
